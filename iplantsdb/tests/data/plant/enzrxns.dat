BASIS-FOR-ASSIGNMENT - :MANUAL

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was identified from a cDNA library of |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| induced <i>Catharanthus roseua</i> cultured cells. The cDNA was expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized with regard to molecular function and catalytic properties. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UGT3) was able to catalyze the sequential sugar chain elongation of |FRAME:CPD-14838 (+)-sesaminol 2-<i>O</i>-&beta;-<i>D</i>-glucoside| to yield, over time, |FRAME:CPD-14839 (+)-sesaminol 2-<i>O</i>-&beta;-<i>D</i>-gentiobioside| and |FRAME:CPD-14841 (+)-sesaminol 2-<i>O</i>-&beta;-<i>D</i>-gentiotrioside|. 
/
/UGT3 only exhibited activity with |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| and catalyzed the 1,6-addition of |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| to another |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| molecule, hence forming gentiosides of varying length. UGT3 transcripts were only detected in leaves of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>.  The <i>in vivo</i> function of UGT3 as sesaminol glucosyltransferase remains to be shown as sesaminol and its gentiosides have not yet been reported from <i>Catharanthus</i> indicating another or additional function of the glucosyltransferase in xenobitics detoxification |CITS:[19561332]|.

COMMENT - The regioselective insertion of a hydroxyl group into the 6-position of the trihydroxyxanthones is catalyzed by xanthone-6-hydroxylase 
/isolated from cell-cultures of <i>Centaurium erythraea</i> and <i>Hypericum androsaemum</i>. The enzyme(s) are 
/characterized as Cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases converting either  1,3,5-trihydroxyxanthone to 
/1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (<i>Centaurium erythraea</i>) or both 1,3,5-trihydroxyxanthone and 1,3,7-trihydroxyxanthone 
/to their corresponding tetrahydroxyxanthones (<i>Hypericum androsaemum</i>). The <i>Hypericum</i> enzyme prefers 
/1,3,7-trihydroxyxanthone but can use 1,3,5-trihydroxyxanthone as well (65% relative activity) whereas the specificity for 
/the <i>Centaurium</i> enzyme is fully restricted to 1,3,5-trihydroxyxanthone |CITS: [10731018]|.

COMMENT - An embryo-defective mutant of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, referred to as <i>bio2</i>, has been generated by ethyl 
/methane sulfonate (EMS) seed mutagenesis. Arrested embryos of the <i>bio2</i> mutant can be rescued by biotin but not 
/by dethiobiotin pointing to a defect of the last committed step in biotin biosynthesis catalyzed by biotin synthase 
/|CITS: [0009501126]|. The cDNA encoding biotin synthase in Arabidopsis was isolated by functional complementation
/of a biotin-auxotroph <i>E. coli</i> mutant (<i>bioB</i>) defective for this enzyme |CITS: [8680961]|. Although the 
/enzyme has been purified from Arabidopsis |CITS: [9428635]| and expressed in <i>E. coli</i> the functionality was 
/found to depend on several unknown components vital for the reaction. 
/
/It was shown that the reaction requires S-adenosyl-methionin (AdoMet), to introduce sulfur into dethiobiotin by means 
/of radical species, and a physiological reduction system to assembly the thiophene ring of biotin |CITS: [11706201]|. 
/This reduction system was shown to consist of mitochondrial components identified as adrenodoxin, adrenodoxin 
/reductase and cystein desulfurase (Nfs1) essential for the catalytic activity |CITS: [12714594]| and confirming the 
/mitochondrial location of the enzyme. Biotin synthase was shown to be a homodimer with a novel iron-sulfur center 
/organization. Two oxygen-sensitive clusters exist, one [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> and one [2Fe-2S]<sup>2+</sup> 
/per monomer to reduce AdoMet and to generate the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical |CITS: [11706201]| |CITS: [12714594]|.
/The [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster is the active form of the biotin synthase |CITS: [12440894]| which only evolves 
/under strict anearobiosis and reducing conditions.
/
/Although the source of sulfur in plants remains to be established the proposal that biotin synthase may act as sulfur 
/donor and not as a catalyst of the reaction |CITS: [9920791]| has been excluded for Arabidopsis by demonstrating the
/catalytic activity of this enzyme <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [11706201]|.

COMMENT - Plant glucosyltransferases are recognized to possess a pronounced capability to glucosylate a broad range of various 
/compounds, ranging from phenols, aromatic acids, coumarins, cyanogenic glucosides, glucosinolates  to flavonoids, 
/anthocyanins and monolignols. 
/
/The glucosylation of selected isoflavones is the first committed reaction towards the interconversion cycle of isoflavone 
/conjugates. The remarkable high specificity of the purified glucosyltransferase for such isoflavones underlines the 
/involvement of those conjugates in the flexible production of defense compounds in legumes |CITS: [6458246]|.
/
/The monomeric UDPG: isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase isolated from <i>Cicer arietinum</i> expressed a specifically 
/high catalytic potential to glucosylate the 7-O-position of isoflavones bearing a hydroxyl or methoxyl group at the 
/para - position of the B-ring.
/
/The 4'-O-methylated isoflavones (biochanin A, formononetin) are the preferred substrates followed by the 
/4'-O-hydroxylated isoflavones (daidzein, genistein) with compareable lower turnover rates |CITS: [6458246]|.
/
/The glucosylation of hydroxyl substitutes isoflavones, flavones, flavanones, flavanols, coumarins, cinnamic acids, and 
/benzoic acids could not be catalyzed at all. Biochanin A and formononetin are the main phenolic constituents in chick 
/pea roots indicating that the isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase may have been adapted in legumes in both a tissue
/and substrate specific manner.

/Nevertheless, the high specificity of the enzyme for isoflavone malonylglucoside (e.g. biochanin A-7-O-glucoside-6"-O-malonate) 
/adds to the body of evidence for an existing interconversion isoflavone conjugate cycle. 
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase isolated from chick pea acts specifically with isoflavone 
/malonylglucosides and is different from unspecific (synthetic) acylhydrolases being active with naphtyl or phenyl esters. 
/
/Ultrafiltration indicated a unusual high molecular weight around 300 kD, however it has been shown that the enzyme 
/aggregates with membrane material. SDS gel electrophoresis resulted in a single subunit of 32 kD |CITS: [3740841]|.
/It has been demonstrated, that the enzyme <i>in vivo</i> binds to membrane structures which may be necessary to achieve 
/full enzyme activity. 
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase is different from other plant esterases being insensitive 
/to most of the usual esterase inhibitors. However, Hg2+ and p-hydroxmercuribenzoate did efficiently inhibit the reaction, 
/suggesting that essential SH groups are required |CITS: [3740841]|.

COMMENT - The final step in the pisatin biosynthetic route is the 3-O-methylation of (+)-6a-hydroxymaackiain. The monomeric 
/(+)-6a-hydroxymaackiain-3-O-methyltransferase (HMM) catalyzing this conversion has been purified from elicited 
/pea seedlings |CITS: [Preisig89]|. The purified enzyme exists as two isoforms (pI 5,2 and 4,9, respectively) and exhibits 
/a specific activity of 8.2ukat/g, so far the highest observed for a plant methyltransferase.
/
/This enzyme, as most of the other enzymes involved in pterocarpan biosynthesis, is strongly induced upon infection or 
/other stress related factors |CITS: [1929414]|. The HMM mRNA translational activity increased considerably, in concert 
/with the first committed enzyme in the biosynthetic sequence phenylalanine-ammonia-lyase (PAL). Based upon this 
/observation it has been suggested that a coordinative link exists between the early and late enzymes of the pathway 
/extending the tight regulation of one or few enzymes along an entire branch of this particular complex biosynthetic 
/pathway |CITS: [1929414]|.
/
/Two cDNA clones (HMM1, HMM2) have been isolated from elicitor challenged pea tissue. The methyltransferase 
/activity was confirmed by heterologous expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> revealing a distinct substrate specificity which 
/was similar to the activity detected in CuCl2-treated pea tissue |CITS: [9349277]|.
/
/The best substrate for the HMM, regardless of its origin (pea crude extract, purified pea enzyme or recombinant 
/proteins), was (+)6a-hydroxymaackiain. HMM1 and HMM2 also methylate (+)-medicarpin with 20,8 and 31,3 % 
/relative activity, respectively. Crude extract and purified pea enzyme converte (+)-medicarpin at a very low level 
/(5% relative activity). HMM2 and the crude extract of pea had 10 and 6 times the activity that HMM1 and the purified 
/pea HMM had on (+)maackiain |CITS: [9349277]|.

COMMENT - The hydroxylation of 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan to 3,6a,9-trihydroxypterocarpan in soybean is carried out by a 
/Cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase (CYP98A1 - accession number D83968), which has been isolated 
/from a elicitor-induced soybean cell culture |CITS: [9720921]|.
/
/The enzyme has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity  |CITS: [2505672]| and could be successfully separated 
/during this process from another Cytochrome P450 enzyme (cinnamate-4-hydroxylase), which is the first report on 
/the separation of two cytochrome P450 enzymes from a higher plant. In addition, the glycoprotein nature of the enzyme
/could be demonstrated by cross-reacting with biotinylated lectins in Western blot |CITS: [1731635]|.
/
/Hagman and coworkers |CITS: [6540173]| demonstrated the specificity of glyceollin accumulation in response to 
/soybean related pathogens. Although unrelated plant pathogens caused an increase of the early and more unspecific 
/enzymes involved in glyceollin biosynthesis, the glyceollin production itself was not affected by such a treatment. The 
/results indicated that the late enzymes in this pathway, including the 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-hydroxylase, may 
/have important regulatory functions in this pathway.
/
/The 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-hydroxylase (D6aH) from <i>Glycine max</i> exhibits a pronaunced stereo- and regiospecificity. 
/The enzyme only accepts (6aR,11aR)-enantiomers of 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan |CITS: [6540173]| |CITS: [9720921]|,
/confirming that hydroxylation proceeds with retention of configuration.
/
/The enzyme characterized here has been isolated, purified and reconstituted using Cytochrome P450 D6aH, the Cytochrome P450 
/reductase, and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine |CITS: [2505672]|.
/
/At present, the experimental data obtained so far point to a enzyme different from the dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-hydroxylase 
/(D6aH) involved in pisatin biosynthesis |CITS: [Matthews87]|, which still remains to be further characterized on a biochemical 
/and molecular level.

COMMENT - The stilbene synthase catalyzing the formation of pinosylvin has been purified to near homogeneity from 4 week old 
/seedlings of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>. The enzyme activity is significantly higher upon stress, i.e. UV and was increased 
/38fold when the gray-mold pathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> was introduced. The dimeric stilbene synthase preferably 
/catalyzed pinosylvin from 3 molecules of malonyl-CoA and cinnamoyl-CoA but also exhibited a high activity towards 
/phenylpropionyl-CoA (dihydrocinnamoyl-CoA) forming dihydropinosylvin |CITS: [Gehlert90]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the final step from isoflavanones to pterocarpans |CITS: [Bless88]| has been named pterocarpan 
/synthase (EC 1.1.1.246). The equivalent enzymatic acitity in alfalfa |CITS: [8071365]| |CITS: [7805842]| has been shown 
/to involve in fact two enzymes (a reductase and a dehydratase), which is probably also true for the enzymatic conversion 
/in soybean.
/
/The enzyme isolated from soybean is only present in challenged tissues |CITS: [Fischer90]| which is unlike to standard 
/grown chickpea cells containing considerable pterocarpan synthase activity. Experiments with a soybean pathogen 
/(<i>Phytophtera megasperma</i>) and a &beta;-glucan elicitor isolated from the cell wall of this fungus suggested that 
/glyceollin production in soybean is highly controlled by temporary gene activation |CITS: [Ebel86]|.
/
/The soybean pterocarpan synthase also differs with respect to the substrate specificity from the corresponding chickpea 
/enzyme. The conversion of both 4-hydroxy (2'-hydroxydihydrodaidzein) and 4-methoxy (vestitone) substituted isoflavones 
/was carried out by the soybean enzyme with equal efficiency in contrast to chickpea pterocarpan synthase accepting 
/solely the 4-methoxy (vestitone) compound |CITS: [Fischer90]|. 
/
/The obtained Km for soybean pterocarpan synthase (75 uM) is the result from an racemic mixture of (R,S)-hydroxydihydrodaidzein. 
/The actual Km should be around 35 to 40 uM  |CITS: [Fischer90]| because only the (3R) or (-)-enantiomer was used to produce 
/the corresponding (-)-pterocarpan.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside hydrolysis catalyses the last step in the interconversion of isoflavone conjugates. 
/The release of the aglycons daidzein, genistein, biochanin a and formononetin, facilitates the recurrence of those 
/compounds in the biosynthetic route towards phytoalexins as immediate defense response or as substrates that may 
/re-enter the cycle to replenish the isoflavone conjugate pool. 
/
/The dimeric (80 and 75 kD subunits) isoflavone-7-O-glucoside &beta;-glucosidase exhibits a pronounced specificity 
/towards glucose |CITS: [11730862]| attached to the 7-O position of the flavonoid nucleus (biochanin A, formononetin, 
/daidzein, genistein). 
/
/Other compounds than isoflavones are much poorer substrates and isoflavones or flavonole being glucosylated at the 
/3'- or 4'-O-position of the B-ring are not hydrolized at all |CITS: [240725]|. It has been shown, that the 7-O-isoflavone 
/specific &beta;-glucosidase of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> was able to hydrolyze both the glucosyl and malonyl glucosyl 
/isoflavones directly with similar kinetics |CITS: [11730862]|.
/
/This may reflect the different biochemistry of the interconversion cycle in <i>Glycine max</i> compared to <i>Cicer arietinum</i>, 
/since no esterase activity for malonyl glucosides of daidzein and genistein could be detected in soybean |CITS: [240725]|.
/
/However, the existence of such a curtailed isoflavone conjugate cycle remains to be demonstrated.

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis PMM gene was able to functional complement a yeast PMM mutant. In vitro assay of its recombinant protein indicated the enzyme required a hexose bisphosphate activator, glucose-1,6-bisphosphate. The enzyme is specific for converting mannose-1-phosphate to mannose-6-phosphate. Its activity in converting glucose-1-phosphate was 10-times slower than that of mannose-1-phosphate. Over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis only slightly increased ascorbate content.

COMMENT - The optimum pH for PLD gamma enzyme activity is 6.5 -7.5.
/The optimum Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is 50 -100 micromolar.
/Like PLD beta, PLD gamma requires the binding of PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) and phosphatidylethanoamine for activity.
/Besides phosphatidylcholine, PLD gamma also hydrolyzes phosphatidylethanoamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, N-acylphosphatidylethanoamine.

COMMENT - Agmatine coumaroyltransferase (ACT) was purified from young barley seedlings. Its cDNA was also cloned and subsequently expressed in E. coli. Both the native and recombinant enzyme showed similar biochemical properties when assayed in vitro. 
/The addition of a thiol was found to be essential to retain enzyme activity. 2-mercaptoethanol and alpha-monothioglycerol were both effective to obtain optimal activity for ACT. However, ACT activity was reduced by 30% in the presence of dithiolthreitol.
/
/ACT had the highest activity for coumaroyl-CoA. It also showed low activity with feruloyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA. In addition to agmatine, tyramine and putrescine were tested as acyl acceptors, but no ACT activity could be detected.

COMMENT - Among the four functional myrosinase genes in the Arabidopsis genome, TGG1 is primarily expressed in leaves, whereas TGG4 and TGG5 are expressed specifically in roots. cDNAs of TGG1, TGG4 and TGG5 were heterologously expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris. The enzyme activities were assayed using the glucosinolate sinigrin as substrate. The enzyme efficiencies of TGG1, TGG4 and TGG5 were similar, with the Kcat/Km values of 53, 48 and 85 s<sup>-1</sup>mM<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.

/The function of the enzyme was confirmed via genetic complementation of a yeast mutant deficient in allantoin hydrolysis. 
/In addition the function of the gene was confirmed by a T-DNA insertion mutant of <i>Arabidopsis</i> being unable to

COMMENT - The potato 5'-nucleotidase has a wide range of substrate specificity.
/Among the tested, 5'-GMP, 5'-AMP, 3'-AMP, and 5'-IMP are all
/comparatively good substrates, whereas, ADP, ATP, 2'-AMP and 3'-GMP are
/poor substrates. In general, purine nucleotides are better substrates
/than pyrimidine nucleotides. The enzyme is activated by a wide variety of
/divalent cations. With 5'-GMP as substrate, the effectiveness of
/activation was Mg2+ > Cu2+, Co2+ > Zn2+ > Fe2+ > Mn2+ > Ni2+. The
/reaction products, nucleosides and phosphate, are inhibitory. The enzyme
/is competitively inhibited by cyclic nucleotides. The Ki for cAMP is 3.4
/uM, and 0.8 uM for cGMP.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the transfer of the glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to the 5-O-position of the 
/flavonoid A-ring of anthocyanidin 3-O-rhamnosylglucoside to form anthocyanidin 3-O-rutinoside-5-O-glucoside, 
/i.e. anthocyanidin 3-O-rutinoside-5-O-glucosyltransferase was partially purified from petals of <i>Silene dioica</i>. 
/The enzyme preferably catalyzed the 5-O-glucosylation of cyanidin 3-O-rhamnosylglucoside but also accepted 
/pelargonidin 3-O-rhamnosylglucoside. It was proposed that the gene M in <i>Silene dioica</i> controls the 
/production of the enzyme because mutant plants lacking the M gene did not express any 5-O-glucosyltransferase 
/activity |CITS: [751641]|.

COMMENT - The 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase (5-FCL) in tomato was identified using the Arabidopsis protein sequence. 
/The enzyme was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> exhibiting a high activity of the tomato 5-FCL. The 
/tomato FCL preferred the pentaglutamyl form of 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate and was specific for the 6S isomer. 
/Cell fractionation in conjunction with immunoblotting revealed that the subcellular location of the 5-FCL is targeted 
/to mitochondria |CITS: [12207015]|. The 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase is the only enzyme known to 
/metabolize 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF). It also strongly inhibits the serine hydroxymethyltransferase 
/(SHMT) catalyzing the formation of serine from glycin. It was proposed that the 5-FCL may participate in the 
/control of mitochondrial 5-CHO-THF during photorespiration |CITS: [15888445]|.

COMMENT - The malonylation of isoflavone glucosides has been suggested to be prerequisite for efficient passage of those 
/compounds through the tonoplast. Malonylation renders the isoflavone glucosides more water soluble, consequently 
/more suitable for vacuole storage. The malonylation step has been discussed as final step of the isoflavone conjugates 
/biosynthesis |CITS: [6639051]|.
/
/However, the isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase activity had been found strongly inhibited 
/by distinct isoflavone-specific malonylesterase and glucohydrolase activities in crude extracts of <i>Cicer arietinum</i>, 
/which rather points at the existence of an isoflavone conjugate cycle with a subcellular compartmentation of the 
/enzyme |CITS: [6497385]|.
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase shows a strong preference for isoflavones being 
/glucosylated at the 7-O-position of the A-ring. Best substrates are the 4'-methoxylated compounds 
/biochanin A-7-O-glucoside and formononetin-7-O-glucoside followed by the 7-O-glucosides of the 4'-hydroxylated 
/isoflavones daidzein and genistein. 
/
/Various 7-O-glucosylated flavones and flavonols could also be converted, however with a greatly decreased affinity 
/for the malonyltransferase. The 4'-O-glucosylated isoflavones could not act as acceptors, indicating that the 
/7-O-glucosylation is a precondition for isoflavone specific malonyltransferase activity |CITS: [6497385]|.
/
/The  isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase had a molecular weight of 112 kD. However, other 
/purified plant malonyltransferases acting on flavone/flavonol-7-O-glucosides or flavonol-3-O-glucosides possess 
/molecular weights of around 50 kD |CITS: [6639051]|. Therefore, a possible dimeric composition of the chick pea 
/enzyme has not yet been excluded.

COMMENT - The gene encoding the flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> was isolated and its 
/molecular function verfied by recombinant expression in yeast. The enzyme converted both naringenin and
/dihydrokaempferol into the corresponding 3',4'-hydroxylated products, i.e. eriodictyol and dihydroquercetin 
/respectively. The enzyme has been characterized as a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase and
/was highly expressed in senescing leaves, flowers and siliques |CITS: [11030432]|

COMMENT - The enzyme can effectively use serine or asparagine as the amino donor, and pyruvate or glyoxylate as the acceptor. 
/Serine and asparagine showed competitive inhibition towards each other, as did pyruvate and glyoxylate. The favored 
/substrate pair is serine and glyoxylate. 
/
/The reaction is reversible, but the equilibrium is toward glycine or alanine production.

COMMON-NAME - curcumin-4'-<i>O</i>-&beta;-<i>D</i>-gentiobioside 1,6-glucosyltransferase
BASIS-FOR-ASSIGNMENT - :MANUAL
CITATIONS - 19561332:EV-EXP-IDA-PURIFIED-PROTEIN-HH:3559303158:hartmut
COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was identified from a cDNA library of |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| induced <i>Catharanthus roseua</i> cultured cells. The cDNA was expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized with regard to molecular function and catalytic properties. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UGT3) was able to catalyze the sequential sugar chain elongation of |FRAME:CPD-6622 curcumin monoglucoside| to yield, over time, |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside|, curcumin gentiotrioside and curcumin gentiotetroside. 
/
/UGT3 only exhibited activity with |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| and catalyzed the 1,6-addition of |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| to another |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| molecule, hence forming gentiosides of varying length. The enzyme did not exhibit activity on the |FRAME:CPD-6602 curcumin| aglycone. The Km values of the monoglucoside |FRAME:CPD-6622 curcumin monoglucoside| and the gentiobioside |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside| were similar  and the Kcat/Km for |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside| was 3 times lower than for |FRAME:CPD-6622 curcumin monoglucoside|. In contrast to that the Km value of quercetin gentiobioside was 5times higher and the enzymatic efficiency (Kcat/Km) was 72times lower compared to |FRAME:CPD1F-437 quercetin-3-glucoside| indicating a better catalytic activity for of UGT3 for |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside| than for its |FRAME:CPD-520 quercetin| counterpart in the quercetin 3-<i>O</i>-gentiotetroside biosynthesis. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase also 1,6-glucosylated |FRAME:CPD-6623 curcumin diglucoside| forming |FRAME:CPD-6625 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobiosyl 4''-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| in the process.
/
/The strict restriction to |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| as sugar donor for UGT3 and the discrepancy in amino acid sequences indicates that UGT3 and the earlier characterized |MONOMER-10641| |CITS:[15178322]| are not identical. UGT3 transcripts were only detected in leaves of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>.  The <i>in vivo</i> function of UGT3 as curcumin glucosyltransferase remains to be shown as curcumin and its gentiosides have not yet been reported from <i>Catharanthus</i> indicating another or additional function of the glucosyltransferase in e.g. xenobitics detoxification |CITS:[19561332]|.

COMMENT - The hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase (HPPR) catalyzing the reduction of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to 4-hydroxyphenyllactate 
/has been partially purified from <i>Coleus blumei</i> |CITS: [Petersen88]| |CITS: [Hausler91]| and characterized. Later on, 
/the <i>Coleus</i> enzyme has been fully purified, cloned and its molecular function closely investigated. It is assumed that the 
/reaction product is the R(+)-stereoisomer of 4- or 3,4- hydroxyphenyllactate since the rosmarinic acid only accepts the R(+)-isoforms. 
/HPPR is discussed as the first specific enzyme for rosmarinic acid biosynthesis since its substrate 4-hydroxypyruvate represents 
/a branch point for other pathways as well (|FRAME:PWY-1422|). The enzyme can use both NADH and NADPH but prefers 
/NADPH over NADH. The highest specificity of the purified and recombinant expressed <i>Coleus</i> enzyme was towards 
/3,4-dihydroxyphenylpyruvate followed by 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The methylation of the phenylpyruvate hydroxygoups results 
/in a lower (monomethylated) or loss (dimethylated) of enzyme activity indicating that the hydroxyl group in the 4-position is 
/essential for HPPR activity. The identification of typical protein domains indicated a close relationship to the family of D-isomer-specific 
/2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases which corresponds to the HPPR activity |CITS: [15284489]|.

COMMENT - Arabidopsis has six acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX) genes. In vitro enzyme assays have determined substrate 
/specificities for ACX1 (long chain), ACX2 (very-long chain), ACX3 (medium chain) and ACX4 (short chain). 
/In vivo studies of enzyme activities using each ACX mutants confirmed in-vitro results |CITS: [15743450]|. 
/In vivo, ACX1 is primarily responsible for C16-C20 substrates, ACX3 for C12 and C14, and ACX4 for C4 
/and C6.
/
/Expressing ACX3 in E. coli followed by enzyme assay indicated that ACX3 is active with medium 
/chain acyl-CoAs ranging from C8 to C14, with peak activity with C12:0-CoA |CITS: [10859203][10918060]|. 
/In vivo study of ACX3 mutant confirmed that ACX3 is active with medium chain 
/acyl-CoAs |CITS: [10918060][15743450]|. Gene expression of ACX3 is strongly up-regulated in 
/germinating seedlings |CITS: [10918060]|.
/  
/The Km for C12:0-CoA is 3.7 uM |CITS: [10918060]|.

COMMENT - Ethanolamine kinase was partially purified from spinach leaves and separated from choline kinase activities present in
/this plant as well. The enzyme was characterized as a soluble protein obtained from the 100.000 x g supernatant, which 
/requires MgATP and free magnesium for maximum activity. The high molecular weight of this enzyme most probably 
/refers to a hexamer, since purification of the enzyme in other plants had indicated readily protein aggregation |CITS: [228735]|. 
/The catalyzed reaction from ethanolamine to phosphoethanolamine matches the pattern expected for a two substrate

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the 7-O specific glucosylation of flavanones has been partially purified from <i>Petunia x hybrida</i>. 
/Although <i>Petunia</i> (in contrast to the genus <i>Citrus</i>) is not known to accumulate flavanone glucosides, such as 
/prunin the corresponding glucosyltransferase activity has been located in leaves and to a lesser extend in sepals. This has 
/been discussed as the reflection of the existent flavonoid profile in <i>Petunia</i> where the key compound naringenin is 
/preferably channeled towards flavonol glucoside and anthocyanin biosynthesis whereas <i>Citrus</i> metabolizes high 
/amounts of flavanone mono- and diglycosides instead. The more than 10.000 times higher sensitivity to UDP of the 
/<i>Petunia</i> 7-O-glucosyltransferase in comparison to the <i>Citrus</i> enzyme may also contribute to the observed 
/different flavonoid pattern in those plants. Three 7-O-glucosyltransferase activities could be isolated from <i>Petunia</i> 
/with either high specificity towards flavanones (naringenin, hesperitin) - this enzyme - or flavonoles (kaempferol, quercetin) 
/and flavones (apigenin, luteolin) |CITS: [10626374]|.

COMMENT - The gene encoding flavanone 7-O-glucoside-2"-O-rhamnosyltransferase (C12RhaT) has been isolated from 
/pummelo (<i>Citrus maxima</i>). The molecular function could be demonstrated in transgenic BY2 tobacco cells 
/where the recombinant protein converted 7-O-glucose flavanone to their corresponding 2"-rhamnosides. The 
/specific attachment of L-rhamnose to the C-2 of the glucose moiety determines the bitter taste characteristic for 
/those plants versus the tasteless <i>Citrus</i> species where L-rhamnose is attached to the C-6 of glucose 
/|CITS: [15361143]|. (1-2)-Rhamnosyltransferase activities in <i>Citrus</i> have been shown to be dependent on 
/developmental stages and are especially high in juvenile plants |CITS: [12232031]|. The enzyme has been purified 
/to homogeneity expressing comparable activities with both 7-O-naringenin (prunin) and 7-O-hesperitin

COMMENT - Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> was isolated using eukaryotic 
/MTHFR's. Two cDNA's have been isolated (AtMTHFR-1 and AtMTHFR-2), shown to encode proteins catalyzing 
/the reductive conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF). 
/5-methyltetrahydrofolate in turn is needed as the methyl donor for methionine biosynthesis from homomethionine. 
/In contrast to mammalian ethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, plant MTHFR's strongly prefer NADH over NADPH 
/(98% loss of activity). AdoMet, inhibitory to the human MTHFR, does not effect or even increases plant MTHFR 
/activity. The dimeric enzyme was found to be cytosolic catalyzing a reversible reaction, which has been discussed 
/as reason for the absence of the allosteric inhibition by AdoMet. Maintaining an pool of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate 
/en route from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate ensures thymidylate and purine biosynthesis without the need of a regulatory 
/mechanism |CITS: [10593891]|.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-2'-hydroxylase (I2'H) catalyzes a critical step in the isoflavonoid biosynthesis towards pterocarpan 
/phytoalexins. The 2'-hydroxylation of the B-ring is prerequisite for the subsequent reduction and ring-closure to 
/arrange the pterocarpan skeleton. The enzyme has been characterized as a cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase. 
/Based on elicitation experiments it has been suggested that I2'H is the rate-determining step in elicitor-induced 
/pterocarpan phytoalexin biosynthesis in chickpea |CITS: [Hinderer87]| |CITS: [Gunia91]|.
/
/The isoflavone-2'-hydroxylase is involved in medicarpin, maackiain, pisatin, phaseollin and glyceollin biosynthesis forming 
/the corresponding 2'-hydroxyisoflavones. Although the 4-hydroxyisoflavones (daidzein, genistein) were not hydroxylated 
/to any significant amount in chickpea |CITS: [Hinderer87]| |CITS: [Clemens93]|, the 2'-hydroxylation of daidzein and genistein 
/is carried out in soybean |CITS: [3956488]| and licorice |CITS: [9790908]|.
/
/In accordance with I2'H's obtained from other plants (<i>Glycyrrhiza echinata</i> - Akashi et al., 1998, <i>Medicago trunkulata</i> - 
/Liu et al., 2003), the enzyme is strongly induced by elicitors and precedes the accumulation of the pterocarpan phytoalexins.

COMMENT - A strictosidine synthase was partially purified from Catharanthus roseus. The enzyme catalyzes the stereo-specific synthesis of 3-alpha(S)-strictosidine, with absolutely no formation of the 3-beta(R) epimer. The enzyme is highly substrate specific. It only has marginal detectable activity with 7-methyltryptamine, 6-hydroxytryptamine or 7-fuorotryptamine replacing tryptamine, or with 2'-O-methylsecologanin, 3'-O-methylsecologanin, or dihydrosecologanin replacing secologanin. Tryptamin of concentrations higher than 1.2 mM is substrate inhibitory.

COMMENT - The isoflavone reductase (IFR) appears to be encoded by a single gene in pea. It converts 2'-hydroxypseudobaptigenin 
/stereospecifically to the (3R)-isoflavanone, i.e. (-)-sophorol, which is the opposite to the final chirality of the pterocarpan 
/(+)-pisatin isolated from this plant  |CITS: [8037464]|.
/
/The stereochemistry of the final pterocarpan is important for determining their fungal toxicity. The IFR provides  the chiral 
/centre at the C-3 atom of the isoflavanone |CITS: [Barz89]| |CITS: [VanEtten83]| and is therefore a preferred target for 
/genetic engineering.
/
/The previous report of a (3S)-configuration of sophorol, in line with the final pterocarpan (S)-pisatin, produced by purified 
/pea IFR |CITS: [Sun91]|, was probably generated under acidic conditions causing a non-enzymatic conversion to the 
/(S)-enantiomer.
/
/The present data suggest a (-)- or (R)-intermediate (sophorol). It has been discussed, that the conformation of 
/(+)-pisatin in  <i>Pisum sativum</i> is established between the isoflavone reduction and the 6a-hydroxymaackiain 
/methylation step, most probably catalyzed by a not yet characterized isomerase |CITS: [Dixon95]|.

COMMENT - The optimum pH is 4.5-5.0. The best substrate is 6G,6-kestotetraose. Other effective substrates tested in-vitro are 6G,1&6-kestopentaose and 6G-kestotriose. Hydrolysis products of the substrate 6G,6-kestotetraose are 6G-kestotriose and fructose. It indicates that the enzyme attacks multiple fructan chains rather than a single chain followed by multiple hydrolysis events. The later mechanism will yield fructose and sucrose from 6G,6-kestotetraose.

COMMENT - Diacylglycerol (DAG) transacylase catalyzes the formation of one molecule triacylglycerol (TAG) and one molecule monoacylglycerol (MAG) from two molecules of DAG. 
/
/DAG transacylase activity was detected in microsomal membrane preparations from immature cotyledons of safflower |CITS: [Stobart97]|. TAG was formed from 1,2-DAG in the absence of acyl-CoA, hence did not involve DAG acyltransferase. The reaction was freely reversible.   
/
/In addition to the report in safflower, DAG transacylase was purified from mouse intestinal microsomes |CITS: [8473321]|. The enzyme was able to use either 1,2- or 2,3-DAG for transacylation. When 1,3-DAG was utilized in the assay, no TAG was formed.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the formation of bis-noryangonin from malonyl-CoA and p-coumaroyl-CoA was partially purified 
/from gametophytes of <i>Equisetum arvense</i>. The soluble styrylpyrone synthase (SPS) expressed the highest specificity 
/towards p-coumaroyl-CoA but also accepted caffeoyl-CoA which leads to the formation of hispidin, another representative 
/of styrylpyrones found in <i>Equisetum</i>. The molecular weight of SPS was found to be between 56 and 77 kDa after 
/size-exclusion chromatography. The enzymatic activity of styrylpyrone synthase results in the constitutive accumulation 
/of bis-noryangonin and hispidin in rhizomes of <i>Equisetum</i> sporophytes and gametophytes where those compounds 
/seem to substitute for the absent flavonoids. The styrylpyrones are thought to be involved in the defense mechanism 
/of the plant against wounding or microbial attack |CITS: [Beckert97]|.

COMMENT - Two cDNA's from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (AtAAPT1, AtAAPT2) have been isolated from an Arabidopsis cDNA 
/library using the AAPT cDNA from soybean as a heterologous hybridization probe. Both cDNA's encode 
/aminoalcoholphosphotransferases involved in the nucleotide pathway of the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 
/and phosphatidylcholine (PC) as demonstrated by gene expression in yeast mutants lacking those enzyme activities. 
/It has been demonstrated that both AtAAPT1 and AtAAPT2 convert CDP-ethanolamine and CDP-choline into the 
/corresponding phopsphatidylalcohols although with slight differences regarding the substrate preference. AtAAPT2 
/showed a higher preference for CDP-choline over CDP-ethanolamine in comparison to AtAAPT1 and was also 
/inhibited to a lesser degree by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Cytidine monophosphate (CMP) than AtAAPT1 |CITS: [GOODE99]|. 
/Both enzymes (AtAAPT1, AtAAPT2) were able to catalyze the reverse reaction supporting the proposal that diacylglycerol, 
/involved as substrate in both PC and triacylglycerol biosynthesis (|FRAME:TRIGLSYN-PWY|), is in equilibrium with 
/PC and maintains this equilibrium via the reversibility of the cholinephosphotransferase reaction |CITS: [SLACK85]|. 
/AtAAPT1 and AtAAPT2 seem to represent the only aminoalcoholphosphotransferases in Arabidopsis as concluded 
/from the Southern blotting patterns. Both polypetides contain seven membrane spanning regions as shown by their 
/hydropathy files. This finding is in agreement with other AAPT's isolated so far and confirms their localization in 
/membranes |CITS: [GOODE99]|.

COMMENT - Purified recombinant UGT71G1 catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to at least two
/different triterpene saponin aglycones in Medicago truncatula, namely medicagenate (medicagenic acid)
/and hederagenin |CITS: [15743451]|. Though single products are formed in these reactions,
/the exact location of the glucosylation remains ambiguous. Both hederagenin and medicagenate may
/be glucosylated on their C-3, C-23, and/or C-28 hydroxyl groups by this enzyme. Docking analysis
/performed using a crystal structure for this enzyme suggests that the C-3 hydroxyl group should be the
/favored substrate for UGT71G1 on these two sapogenins |CITS: [16214900]|. However, the
/medicagenate-monoglucoside products generated by in vitro reactions using purified recombinant
/UGT71G1 did not co-chromatograph with an authentic sample of medicagenate-3-glucoside
/|CITS: [15743451]|. 
/
/UGT71G1 does not appear to glycosylate three other prevalent triterpene sapogenins, soyasapogenols
/B and E, and bayogenin in vitro, nor does it catalyze reactions using UDP-galactose or UDP-glucuronic
/acid. However, it does show high levels of activity with several other phenolic substrates. Notably,
/UGT71G1 has a lower Km (<50 uM) and a higher Kcat (> 0.12 /sec) with |FRAME: CPD-520 quercetin|,
/|FRAME: CPD-3141 genistein|, and |FRAME:BIOCHANIN-A biochanin-A| than with hederagenin
/(Km = 166 uM, Kcat = 0.025 /sec). Mutational analysis has been
/used to identify residues in UGT71G1 that influence its regioselectivity for |FRAME: CPD-520 quercetin| and
/|FRAME: CPD-3141 genistein| |CITS: [16982612]|. Though this information could be used to help to design enzymes capable
/of generating desirable glycosylated phenolics |CITS: [16982612]|, combined transcript and
/metabolite analyses suggest that hederagenin and medicagenate are the biologically relevant
/substrates of UGT71G1 |CITS: [15743451]|. For instance, methyl jasmonate treatment of dark-grown cell suspension
/cultures up-regulates UGT71G1 transcript levels. Triterpene saponin glycosides also accumulate under
/these conditions, whereas flavonoid / isoflavonoid glycoside levels do not rise. On the other hand, the
/levels of these (iso)flavonoid compounds, such as genistein-7-O-glucoside, rise following treatment
/with yeast elicitor even though UGT71G1 transcript levels do not increase.
/In addition, there is no evidence of quercetin glycosides present either in uninduced or
/yeast-elicitor-induced cultures,  suggesting that the best in vitro substrate does not get glycosylated
/by UGT71G1 in these M. truncatula cell lines |CITS: [15743451]|. 
/
/UGT71G1 transcripts can be detected by RT-PCR in roots, leaves, peticles, stems, and at somewhat
/higher levels in flowers |CITS: [15743451]|. Due to its presumed role in plant defense, elevated
/levels of UGT71G1 transcripts can be detected 24 hours after methyl jasmonate induction. The levels
/of this transcript increase later than the levels of transcripts for UGT73K1 another
/UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) active on triterpene sapogenins, and |FRAME: MONOMER-12196 &beta;-amyrin synthase|,
/an important upstream enzyme required for the formation of the sapogenin substrates of UGT71G1.
/Interestingly, the expected products of UGT71G1 also appear later than those of
/UGT73K1 |CITS: [15743451]|. 
/
/UGT71G1 appears to be a member of a subfamily of UDP-glycosyltransferases that includes the
/UGT71D2 protein from Arabidopsis |CITS: [11042215], [15743451]|. These and other closely related
/proteins from cassava (Manihot esculenta) and Solanum tuberosum |CITS: [15743451]|
/belong to the larger <A href="http://www.cazy.org/fam/GT1.html">Glycosyltransferase Family1</A>.

COMMENT - The potato 5'-nucleotidase has a wide range of substrate specificity.
/Among the tested, 5'-GMP, 5'-AMP, 3'-AMP, and 5'-IMP are all
/comparatively good substrates, whereas, ADP, ATP, 2'-AMP and 3'-GMP are
/poor substrates. In general, purine nucleotides are better substrates
/than pyrimidine nucleotides. The enzyme is activated by a wide variety of
/divalent cations. With 5'-GMP as substrate, the effectiveness of
/activation was Mg2+ > Cu2+, Co2+ > Zn2+ > Fe2+ > Mn2+ > Ni2+. The
/reaction products, nucleosides and phosphate, are inhibitory. The enzyme
/is competitively inhibited by cyclic nucleotides. The Ki for cAMP is 3.4
/uM, and 0.8 uM for cGMP.

COMMENT - The gene of Arabidopsis (At5g48930) has been shown to encode the hydroxycinnamoyl-Coenzyme A 
/shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) both synthesizing and catabolizing the hydroxycinnamoylesters 
/(coumaroyl/caffeoyl shikimate and quinate) involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway |CITS: [12381722]|. 
/The function of the Arabidopsis gene was characterized by the observed effects of HCT gene repression by 
/RNA silencing. The resulting plants show a dwarf phenotype and sterility. The silencing of HCT leads to 
/altered soluble phenylpropanoid production, lignin content and composition (increased H units versus S units) 
/with a favored production of guaiacyl lignin. That could be demonstrated in silencing the corresponding gene 
/in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> since the dwarf phenotype and sterility of Arabidopsis did not allow to 
/gather enough tissue for in-depth investigation of the lignin polymer |CITS: [15161961]|.

COMMENT - Two cDNA clones have been isolated from rice, each encodes a 9/13-HPL. The recombinant OsHPL1 has a relative activity of 100:66:20:61 towards 9-HPOT, 9-HPOD, 13-HPOT and 13-HPOD. The recombinant OsHPL2 has a relative activity of 100:93:85:59 towards 9-HPOT, 9-HPOD, 13-HPOT and 13-HPOD. Both enzymes have the highest activity towards 9-HPOT. OsHPL2 metabolizes 9-HPOD and 13-HPOT better than that of OsHPL1.

COMMENT - The functional specificity of the isoflavone-7-O-glucoside &beta;-glucosidase of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> appears to be very 
/similar to that of the &beta;-glucosidase found in <i>Glycine max</i> |CITS: [11730862]|.
/
/The &beta;-glucosidase is found throughout the plant as multiple molecular forms and constitutes especially in roots 
/a considerable portion of the extractable protein. SDS electrophoresis revealed, that the enzyme consists of two 
/subunits (~68 kD) and the isoelectric points of the various species ranged between 5.9 and 7.1 |CITS: [240725]|.
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside specific &beta;-glucosidase showed two pH optima, a broad one from 7.0 - 7.5 with an 
/additional minor optimum at 4.5 to 5.0, in contrast to most plant &beta;-glucosidases which possess their main pH optimum 
/around 5.0 |CITS: [240725]|.

COMMENT - Three cytochrome P450 81E subfamily members (CYP81E7 - 9) have been obtained from the EST database of 
/<i>Medicago truncatula</i>, two of them clearly involved in the 2'- and 3'-hydroxylation of isoflavones. Amongst them, 
/the CYP81E7 enzyme encodes for isoflavone 2'-hydroxylase catalyzing the essential 2'-hydroxylation of the B-ring 
/prior to reduction and ring closure, which completes the pterocarpan backbone structure |CITS: [14617078]|.
/
/Recombinant proteins from yeast were able to convert formononetin to 2'-hydroxyformononetin and biochanin A to 
/2'-hydroxybiochanin A, confirming the enzyme to be isoflavone 2'-hydroxylase. The isoflavone 2'-hydroxylase has 
/been successfully introduced into <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, where the functional protein hydroxylated formononetin 
/at the 2'-position of the B-ring yielding 2'-hydroxyformononetin, both compounds not naturally occurring in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
/ 
/
/Taken into consideration, that another crucial enzyme for isoflavone biosynthesis, i.e. isoflavone synthase (IFS), has 
/also been functionally expressed in <i>Arabidopsis</i>  |CITS: [10657130]| it seems now possible to introduce 
/pterocarpan biosynthesis in non-legume plants. Interestingly, IFS was co-expressed with I2'H after elicitation in 
/<i>Medicago truncatula</i>, indicating a possible physical association of the two enzymes. 
/
/I2'H was constitutively expressed in <i>Medicago</i> roots, and was induced by elicitor and/or infection in leaves. The 
/expression/induction pattern of I2'H differs significantly from that of I3'H (isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase, CYP81E9), pointing 
/to the involvement of I2'H in other pathways than I3'H, however the actual role of I3'H remains to be explored |CITS: [14617078]|.

COMMENT - 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH) is encoded by a single copy gene
/in Arabidopsis. The identity of the cDNA clone was confirmed by
/functional complementation of an E. coli auxotrophic mutant lacking the
/PGDH locus. Like the enzymes from spinach and mammals, the Arabidopsis enzyme is not
/feedback inhibited by serine, whereas the pea and E. coli enzymes were
/reported to be inhibited by serine. In-vitro assay indicated the
/Arabidopsis PGDH has much lower activity in the physiological direction
/of oxidizing 3PGA to 3PHP than the opposite direction of reducing 3PHP
/to 3PGA.

COMMENT - The sinapate glucosyltransferase purified from seedlings of <i>Brassica napus</i> is a key enzyme in the sinapate 
/ester biosynthesis and considered as a target for the genetic engineering of low- sinapine Brassica genotypes.
/
/The cytosolic location for this enzyme has been confirmed supporting the proposal that sinapoylglucose 
/must be transported to the vacuole for continuing biosynthesis of the various sinapate esters |CITS: [Wang98]|.
/
/The partially purified monomeric enzyme was inhibited by several divalent cations (Zn2+, Cu2+, Hg2+). Its catalytic 
/mechanism was proposed to be "random bi-bi", because the enzyme did not follow the binding order UDPG - sinapic 
/acid required for an "ordered bi-bi" model |CITS: [Wang98]|.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside hydrolysis catalyses the last step in the interconversion of isoflavone conjugates. 
/The release of the aglycons daidzein, genistein, biochanin a and formononetin, facilitates the recurrence of those 
/compounds in the biosynthetic route towards phytoalexins as immediate defense response or as substrates that 
/may re-enter the cycle to replenish the isoflavone conjugate pool. 
/
/The dimeric (80 and 75 kD subunits) isoflavone-7-O-glucoside &beta;-glucosidase exhibits a pronounced specificity 
/towards glucose |CITS: [11730862]| attached to the 7-O position of the flavonoid nucleus (biochanin A, formononetin, 
/daidzein, genistein). 
/
/Other compounds than isoflavones are much poorer substrates and isoflavones or flavonole being glucosylated at the 
/3'- or 4'-O-position of the B-ring are not hydrolized at all |CITS: [240725]|. It has been shown, that the 7-O-isoflavone 
/specific &beta;-glucosidase of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> was able to hydrolyze both the glucosyl and malonyl glucosyl 
/isoflavones directly with similar kinetics |CITS: [11730862]|.
/
/This may reflect the different biochemistry of the interconversion cycle in <i>Glycine max</i> compared to <i>Cicer arietinum</i>, 
/since no esterase activity for malonyl glucosides of daidzein and genistein could be detected in soybean |CITS: [240725]|.
/
/However, the existence of such a curtailed isoflavone conjugate cycle remains to be demonstrated.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM3) has been identified and partially characterized 
/in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. MAM3, also known as MAM-L catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with 
/a series of &omega;-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic acids which are involved in the biosynthesis of the C3 to C8 
/aliphatic glucosinolates know to occur in Arabidopsis. This molecular function was confirmed by recombinant 
/expression and characterization of the enzyme in <i>E. coli</i> and complementation of MAM3 deficient mutants 
/of Arabidopsis that lack the range of long chain C6 to C8 glucosinolates. The enzyme in general expressed 
/broad substrate specificity towards substrates such as pyruvate and 2-oxoisovalerate converting them to citramalate 
/and 2-isopropylmalate, respectively. However, it has been demonstrated that this does not represent an <i>in vivo</i> 
/activity of the enzyme. MAM3 has been shown to be localized in chloroplasts |CITS: [17369439]|.

COMMENT - The last step to form the isoflavonoid skeleton is the elimination of water from the 2-hydroxyisoflavanones, catalyzed 
/by 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (HID).  Although a spontaneous dehydration has been demonstrated under 
/acidic conditions |CITS: [Hakamatsuka98]| the rate constant (Kcat) under physiological conditions was 170.000 times faster 
/for the enzymatic reaction |CITS: [15734910]|.
/
/Hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase cDNA clones obtained from licorice and soybean, showed distinctive substrate 
/preferences and could be classified into HIDM (HID methoxy type - <i>Glycyrrhiza echinata</i>) and HIDH (HID hydroxy 
/type - <i>Glycine max</i>). The soybean enzyme possed a broader substrate spectrum converting both 4'-hydroxy and 
/4'-methoxy-2'-hydroxyisoflavanones to either daidzein (genistein) or formononetin |CITS: [15734910]|. This substrate 
/preference coincides with the isoflavonoid profile found in soybean, characterized by mostly hydroxylated intermediates 
/and final products (daidzein, glyceollin).
/
/Both HIDs possess motifs characteristic of carboxylesterases, however esterase activities have not been detected for 
/this proteins. It has been concluded that the HIDs represent an example of recruitment of enzymes of primary metabolism 
/during the molecular evolution of plant secondary metabolism as suggested by Pichersky and Gang (2000) |CITS: [11044721]|.

COMMENT - Whisk fern (<i>Psilotum nudum</i>) contains a small family of 5 CHS/STS synthases, two of them representing 
/stilbene synthases which catalyze the formation of pinosylvin from malonyl-CoA and cinnamoyl-CoA. A cDNA 
/encoding a pinosylvin-forming synthase (PnI) was isolated from shoots of <i>Psilotum nudum</i> subsequently 
/recombinant expressed, purified and partly characterized in <i>E. coli</i>. The dimeric enzyme preferred cinnamoyl-CoA 
/but also could use p-coumaryl-CoA producing resveratrol and the derailment products bisnoryangonin (BNY) and 
/p-coumaroyltriacetic acid lactone (CTAL) (|FRAME:PWY-84|) being indicative for stilbene synthases |CITS: [11762173]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme glyceollin synthase catalyzes the last committed step in glyceollin biosynthesis. The enzyme has been 
/characterized as an Cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase |CITS: [Welle88a]| converting the various glyceollidins 
/(I and II) into the corresponding glyceollins (I - III) by cyclization of the prenyl residue. 
/
/Is has been argued that there could be more than one cyclase enzyme present in soybean because the microsomal 
/fraction catalyzed not only cyclization of both 4- and 2-dimethylallyl-glycinols to glyceollin I and II with a 2,2-dimethylchromen 
/ring but also the formation of glyceollin III with a 2-isopropenyldihydrofuran ring |CITS: [Welle88a]|. However, to verify this 
/assumption implies the purification and separation of pathway specific Cytochrome P 450's, which has not yet achieved 
/for the glyceollin biosynthetic route and awaits further research.
/
/There are reports on other cyclases, e.g. isolated from the tropical legume <i>Tephrosia vogelii</i> |CITS: [Crombie86]|, 
/and the umbelliferous plant bishop's weed (<i>Ammi majus</i>) |CITS: [2828055]|. The results show that the cyclases, 
/involved in different pathways (furanocoumarins - |CITS: [2828055]|, rotenoids - |CITS: [Crombie86]|), can be either a 
/soluble enzyme |CITS: [Crombie86]| or a membrane-bound Cytochrome P450 |CITS: [Welle88a]| |CITS: [2828055]|. 
/
/The soybean cyclase had a very broad pH optimum ranging from 7.5 to 9.5. The enzyme was inhibited by its final 
/product glyceollin. Glyceollin can accumulate to high concentrations (3mM) in infected soybean tissues but it was 
/discussed that this may not be the sites where the active biosynthesis takes place |CITS: [Welle88a]|. 
/
/In agreement with findings of all the other specific enzymes involved in glyceollin biosynthesis, glyceollin synthase 
/was not present in unchallenged tissues but was induced rapidly upon elicitation with the glucan elicitor from 
/<i>P. megasperma</i> and yeast extracts. The activity profile of the cyclase parallels that of the prenylase, reaching 
/a distinct maximum after 24 hrs and slowly declining afterwards |CITS: [Welle88a]|.

COMMENT - The enzymatic activity of an anthocyanin 5'-<i>O</i>-glucosyltransferase (5'GT) was identified in the crude 
/extract from petals of <i>Clitoria ternatea</i>. The enzyme did glucosylate the 5'-position of the B-ring of 
/delphinidin 3-<i>O</i>-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside-3'-<i>O</i>-glucoside to form the corresponding 3',5'-<i>O</i>-&beta;-glucoside. 
/The anthocyanin composition of mauve flower color mutants of Clitoria that could not produce ternatins and 
/therefore lacked the blue color revealed that those plants only accumulated delphinidin 3-<i>O</i>-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside. 
/Enzyme preparations of the mauve line did not glucosylate delphinidin 3-<i>O</i>-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside or 
/its 3'-<i>O</i>-glucoside derivative indicating that those plants had lost 3'GT and 5'-GT activity |CITS: [Kazuma04]|. 
/It is not clear whether the glucosylation of the 3' and 5'-position of delphinidin 3-<i>O</i>-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside 
/is catalyzed by two different glucosyltransferases (3'GT and 5'GT) or one enzyme glucosylating both positions.

COMMENT - In Arabidopsis, there are four members in the CYP81F subfamily. Heterologous expression and enzyme assay indicated that all four catalyzed the conversion of I3M to 1OH-I3M. However, Genetics data indicated that CYP81F4 is mainly responsible for the generation of 1MO-I3M, the downstream methylated product of 1OH-I3M, in vivo. 1MO-I3M was virtually absent in CYP81F4 knockout mutants |CITS: [21317374]|.

COMMENT - The last step to form the isoflavonoid skeleton is the elimination of water from the 2-hydroxyisoflavanones, catalyzed by 
/2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (HID).  Although a spontaneous dehydration has been demonstrated under acidic 
/conditions |CITS: [Hakamatsuka98]| the rate constant (Kcat) under physiological conditions was 170.000 times faster 
/for the enzymatic reaction |CITS: [15734910]|.
/
/Hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase cDNA clones obtained from licorice and soybean, showed distinctive substrate 
/preferences and could be classified into HIDM (HID methoxy type - <i>Glycyrrhiza echinata</i>) and HIDH (HID 
/hydroxy type - <i>Glycine max</i>). The licorice enzyme exhibits a very narrow substrate specificity with a strong 
/preference of 2,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone, forming formononetin |CITS: [15734910]|. This substrate preference 
/coincides with the isoflavone pattern found in licorice, representing methyl-substituted compounds.
/
/The licorice enzyme is also most probably involved in biochanin A biosynthesis as it preferably dehydrates

/Hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase cDNA clones obtained from licorice and soybean, showed distinctive substrate 
/preferences and could be classified into HIDM (HID methoxy type - <i>Glycyrrhiza echinata</i>) and HIDH (HID 
/hydroxy type - <i>Glycine max</i>). The licorice enzyme exhibits a very narrow substrate specificity with a strong 
/preference of 2,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone, forming formononetin |CITS: [15734910]|. This substrate preference 
/coincides with the isoflavone pattern found in licorice, representing methyl-substituted compounds.
/
/The licorice enzyme is also most probably involved in biochanin A biosynthesis as it preferably dehydrates 
/2,5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone into biochanin A. This enzymatic step implies the 4'-methoxylation of

COMMENT - The enzyme activity does not require metal ions. Addition of EDTA had no effects. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by the addition of 10mM p-chloromercuribenzoate (98% reduction), 10 mM iodoacetamide (63%), 5 mM heavy metal cobalt (96%), copper (98%), manganese (82%), and zinc (98%). The enzyme specifically methylates the 6-position of desoxyhemigossypol. Hemigossypol, 2,7-dihydroxycadalene, caffeic acid, 4-methylcatechol, or 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene was not mehtylated.

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding a pinoslylvin forming stilbene synthase (STS2) was isolated from wound and elicitor induced seedlings 
/of <i>Pinus strobus</i> using the STS of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> for screening the <i>P. strobus</i> cDNA library. The 
/protein was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and characterized. STS2 preferentially used cinnamoyl-CoA forming 
/pinosylvin and is therefore a pinosylvin synthase. The enzyme was the main pinosylvin-producing synthase in <i>Pinus strobus</i> 
/since the other enzyme STS1 (|FRAME:CPLX-6965|) only reached 3 to 5% activity of STS2. It was shown that STS2 
/preferred a higher pH than STS1 and that one amino acid exchange in the protein sequence was responsible for the 
/different properties of STS1 and STS2 |CITS: [7698342]|.

COMMENT - The UDPG:coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferase (CAGT) was isolated and partially purified from developing xylem of 
/<i>Pinus strobus</i>. The enzyme has been purified from actively lignifying tissues as the accumulation of coniferin, 
/i.e. the highest activity of the CAGT coincides with events of wood formation such as the appearance of differentiated 
/tracheids undergoing secondary-wall formation and lignification |CITS: [Savidge98]| |CITS: [11430981]|. The partially 
/purified enzyme expressed high affinities towards coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol, as well as for their aldehydes and 
/dihydroconiferyl alcohol. The CAGT from <i>Pinus strobus</i> only accepts <i>trans</i>-configured substrates forming 
/the corresponding E-glucosides in contrast to the Z-glucosides found in <i>Fagus grandifolia</i> |CITS: [11537477]|.

COMMENT - Whereas no enzymatic data is currently available for this enzyme, it has been shown that when an antisense <i>CYP51G1</i> was introduced into <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the obtusifoliol content of the transformed plants increased whereas campesterol and campestanol levels remained unchanged |CITS:11437378|. Additionally, CYP51 was shown to complement the yeast <i>&Delta;erg11</i> strain clearly indicating that CYP51 possesses sterol 14&alpha;-demethylase activity. More comprehensive enzymatic data was obtained from the study of |FRAME:MONOMER-7161|.

BASIS-FOR-ASSIGNMENT - :MANUAL
CITATIONS - 19561332:EV-EXP-IDA-PURIFIED-PROTEIN-HH:3559303362:hartmut
COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was identified from a cDNA library of |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| induced <i>Catharanthus roseua</i> cultured cells. The cDNA was expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized with regard to molecular function and catalytic properties. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UGT3) was able to catalyze the sequential sugar chain elongation of |FRAME:CPD-6622 curcumin monoglucoside| to yield, over time, |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside|, curcumin gentiotrioside and curcumin gentiotetroside. 
/
/UGT3 only exhibited activity with |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| and catalyzed the 1,6-addition of |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| to another |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| molecule, hence forming gentiosides of varying length. The enzyme did not exhibit activity on the |FRAME:CPD-6602 curcumin| aglycone. The Km values of the monoglucoside |FRAME:CPD-6622 curcumin monoglucoside| and the gentiobioside |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside| were similar  and the Kcat/Km for |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside| was 3 times lower than for |FRAME:CPD-6622 curcumin monoglucoside|. In contrast to that the Km value of quercetin gentiobioside was 5times higher and the enzymatic efficiency (Kcat/Km) was 72times lower compared to |FRAME:CPD1F-437 quercetin-3-glucoside| indicating a better catalytic activity for of UGT3 for |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside| than for its |FRAME:CPD-520 quercetin| counterpart in the quercetin 3-<i>O</i>-gentiotetroside biosynthesis. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase also 1,6-glucosylated |FRAME:CPD-6623 curcumin diglucoside| forming |FRAME:CPD-6625 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobiosyl 4''-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| in the process.
/
/The strict restriction to |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| as sugar donor for UGT3 and the discrepancy in amino acid sequences indicates that UGT3 and the earlier characterized |MONOMER-10641| |CITS:[15178322]| are not identical. UGT3 transcripts were only detected in leaves of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>.  The <i>in vivo</i> function of UGT3 as curcumin glucosyltransferase remains to be shown as curcumin and its gentiosides have not yet been reported from <i>Catharanthus</i> indicating another or additional function of the glucosyltransferase in e.g. xenobitics detoxification |CITS:[19561332]|.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-2'-hydroxylase (I2'H) catalyzes a critical step in the isoflavonoid biosynthesis towards pterocarpan 
/phytoalexins. The 2'-hydroxylation of the B-ring is prerequisite for the subsequent reduction and ring-closure to 
/arrange the pterocarpan skeleton. The enzyme has been characterized as a cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase. 
/Based on elicitation experiments it has been suggested that I2'H is the rate-determining step in elicitor-induced 
/pterocarpan phytoalexin biosynthesis in chickpea |CITS: [Hinderer87]| |CITS: [Gunia91]|.
/
/The isoflavone-2'-hydroxylase is involved in both medicarpin and maackiain biosynthesis forming 2'-hydroxyformononetin
/and 2'-hydroxypseudobaptigenin, respectively. I2'H preferably hydroxylates 4-methoxyisoflavones (formononetin, 
/biochanin A), whereas the corresponding 4-hydroxyisoflavones (daidzein, genistein) were not hydroxylated to any 
/significant amount in chickpea |CITS: [Hinderer87]| |CITS: [Clemens93]|. Among the 4-methoxyisoflavones I2'H shows
/preference for the 5-hydroxy-substituted biochanin A over its corresponding 5-deoxy derivative formononetin.
/
/In accordance with I2'H's obtained from other plants (<i>Glycyrrhiza echinata</i> - |CITS: [9790908]|, <i>Medicago trunkulata</i>
/-  |CITS: [14617078]|), the enzyme is strongly induced by elicitors and precedes the accumulation of the chickpea pterocarpan 
/phytoalexins.

COMMENT - The dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHNA) was isolated from a tomato cDNA using a full-length potato EST for reverse 
/transcription PCR. The obtained cDNA was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and was able to carry out both the
/aldol and epimerization reaction on dihydroneopterin. The enzyme forms a D(4)-symmetric homooctamer and is related 
/to substructures of dihydroneopterin triphosphate epimerase |CITS: [15165863]|. Although the physiological role of the 
/epimerization reaction remains to be solved it was proposed that the formation of tetrahydromonapterin derived from the 
/epimerization activity may substitute for the missing plant cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, necessary for  the function of 
/certain hydroxylases and NO synthase |CITS: [15107504]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding methionine synthase (MS) was isolated from <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> and characterized 
/by structural evidence and functional complementation of a methionine synthase-negative mutant strain of <i>E. coli</i>. 
/The enzyme is of a cobalamin-independent type using methyltetrahydrofolate poly (or less frequent mono) 
/glutamates as methyl donors. The enzyme catalyzes the last step in methionine biosynthesis and represents the 
/convergence point of two biochemical areas, the methionine biosynthesis and the one-carbon-cycle. Experimental

COMMENT - In-vitro assay of crude cell extracts expressing APR1, APR2 or APR3 indicated that all three isoenzymes have similar APS reductase activities. The enzyme activity with APS is 30- to 50-fold higher than with PAPS, and the activity is dependent on DTT. Sodium sulfate and ammonium sulfate stimulate the enzyme activity, whereas 5'-AMP inhibits the activity with a Ki value of 0.3 mM. The optimum pH for enzyme activity is 8.5.|CITS: [8917600]|
/
/APR1, APR2, and APR3 have been shown to use glutathione as the hydrogen donor in vitro. The Km value for glutathione of the three isomers range from 0.6 to 1.2 mM.|CITS: [9653199]|

COMMENT - Three isomers of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) were isolated from <i>Anchusa officinalis</i> |CITS: [De-Eknamkul87]| 
/and named after their order of elution in anion-exchange TAT-1, TAT-2 and TAT-3 |CITS: [2889425]|. Tyrosine aminotransferases 
/represent the entrypoint enzyme of the tyrosine-derived pathway involved in rosmarinic acid biosynthesis and express, 
/in contrast to other plant aromatic aminotransferases, a relatively high specificity towards L-tyrosine. The observed high 
/pH optimum (TAT-2 > pH 9.6) also distinguishes those enzymes from other plant aromatic aminotransferases. The enzyme 
/catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate with oxaloacetate being the best co-substrates. 
/TAT-2 has been purified to homogeneity and was shown to be a tetramer with subunits of 56 kDa |CITS: [2889425]|.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-3'-hydroxylase (I3'H) catalyzes the 3'-hydroxylation of biochanin A leading to the isoflavonoid pratensein. 
/The enzyme has been characterized as a cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase |CITS: [Hinderer87]| |CITS: [Gunia91]|.
/
/The isoflavone-3'-hydroxylase is involved in both maackiain biosynthesis and the formation of 2'-hydroxybiochanin A
/(pratensein). I3'H preferably hydroxylates 4-methoxyisoflavones (formononetin, biochanin A), whereas the corresponding 
/4-hydroxyisoflavones (daidzein, genistein) were not hydroxylated to any significant amount in chickpea |CITS: [Hinderer87]|
/|CITS: [Clemens93]|.
/
/Among the 4-methoxyisoflavones I3'H shows no particular preference for the 5-hydroxy-substituted biochanin A over its 
/corresponding 5-deoxy derivative formononetin |CITS: [Clemens93]|. This is in contradiction to findings in <i>Medicago truncatula</i>, 
/where biochanin A is the preferred substrate for 3'-hydroxylation |CITS: [14617078]|.
/
/The enzyme is strongly induced by elicitors and precedes the accumulation of the chickpea pterocarpan phytoalexins, however the 
/induction pattern of I3'H differs substantially from that of the closely related I2'H |CITS: [Gunia91]|. The observation 
/that I3'H, in contrast to I2'H, is strongly induced in susceptible cell cultivars of chickpea and the noticeable difference
/in the sensitivity towards certain inhibitors |CITS: [Clemens93]|, suggests that more than one isoflavone-hydroxylase accounts for 
/the four measurable isoflavone hydroxylase activities in chickpea.

COMMENT - Arabidopsis plants accumulate scopoletin, predominantly in roots. The caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, CCoAOMT1 (At4G34050), is involved in producing the precursor feruloyl-CoA. The amount of scopoletin in CCoAOMT1 mutant plant roots was only 30% of the level in wild-type roots. In an in vitro assay of the recombinant CCoAOMT1, caffeoyl-CoA was shown a good substrate. In contrast, the enzyme activity with caffeic acid was only 5% of the activity with caffeoyl-CoA.

COMMENT - CTP:cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase (CCT) was purified to appareant homogeneity from endosperm of castor 
/bean. The functional protein appears to be a tetramer, composed of four 40 kDa monomers. The purified enzyme used 
/both monomethylethanolamine phosphate (MMEtaP) and phosphocholine (PC) as substrate but not ethanolamine 
/phosphate (EtaP) or dimethylethanolamine phosphate (DMEtaP), indicating that more than one CCT may be present 
/in castor bean. The MMEtaP activity of the purified enzyme was strongly inhibited by phosphocholine. The enzyme was
/characterized as a hydrophobic protein associated with a membrane fraction |CITS: [WANG90]|. However, CCT activities 
/can be restored from both microsomal fractions and the soluble fraction |CITS: [8756587]|. The CCT activity of 
/castor bean is modulated by lipids. Phospholipids isolated either from castor bean endosperm or phosphatidylcholine-
/oleate vesicles |CITS: [WANG90]| more than double the CCT activity of the purified protein.

COMMENT - The potato 5'-nucleotidase has a wide range of substrate specificity.
/Among the tested, 5'-GMP, 5'-AMP, 3'-AMP, and 5'-IMP are all
/comparatively good substrates, whereas, ADP, ATP, 2'-AMP and 3'-GMP are
/poor substrates. In general, purine nucleotides are better substrates
/than pyrimidine nucleotides. The enzyme is activated by a wide variety of
/divalent cations. With 5'-GMP as substrate, the effectiveness of
/activation was Mg2+ > Cu2+, Co2+ > Zn2+ > Fe2+ > Mn2+ > Ni2+. The
/reaction products, nucleosides and phosphate, are inhibitory. The enzyme
/is competitively inhibited by cyclic nucleotides. The Ki for cAMP is 3.4
/uM, and 0.8 uM for cGMP.

COMMENT - Two isoforms of NADP phosphatase have been isolated from caryopses of <i>Avena sativa</i> being involved in different 
/developmental stages of the embryo. One of the isoforms with a molecular weight of 37 kDa is present in both dormant and 
/after-ripened caryopses expressing a rather broad activity towards a number of phosphorylated compounds. The enzyme 
/expressed a high inorganic pyrophosphatase activity and efficiently hydrolyzed other compounds such as adenosine triphosphate, 
/adenosine diphosphate, carbamyl phosphate and phosphoenol pyruvate. Compared to the specificity of the second NADP 
/phosphatase isoform (160 kDa) the hydrolyzation of NADP to form NAD was rather weak |CITS: [10944152]|.

COMMENT - The <i>O</i>-methyltransferase cloned from <i>Populus deltoides</i> (TIGR accession no. TC22004), expressed as GST-fusion protein in <i>E. coli</i> and purified to homogeneity methylated various phenylpropanoids such as quercetin, caffeic acid, esculetin and daphnetin. This <i>O</i>-methyltransferase was able to produce three different methylated products when esculetin was used as a substrate, i.e. scopoletin, isoscopoletin and the double-methylated scoparone. The metabolic accumulation and degradation pattern over time of scopoletin , isoscopoletin and scoparone indicated that scoparone was produced via isoscopoletin and did not use scopoletin as an intermediate |CITS:[16717435]|.

COMMENT - The 4'-O-methylation of 2'-hydroxyisoflavanones leading to 4'-methylated intermediates (e.g. formononetin, biochanin A)
/crucial for the production of defensive compounds (pterocarpan phytoalexins) is a long standing problem, which has 
/not been unambiguously resolved. It has been suggested, that the isoflavone-7-O-methyltransferase (IOMT) through 
/its intracellular compartmentation with other enzymes of the pterocarpan biosynthetic pathway could produce the 
/4'-O-methylester |CITS: [11752378]|, however biochemical evidence has not yet been presented.
/
/A cDNA encoding a new enzyme (SAM: 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4'-O-methyltransferase - HI4'OMT) has been
/obtained through screening of functional expressed licorice cDNAs, which catalyzes the formation of formononetin but
/excluding daidzein as an intermediate |CITS: [12610212]| |CITS: [11129614]|. Instead a different enzyme 
/(daidzein-7-O-methyltransferase - D7OMT) has been demonstrated to be responsible for the formation of 7-O-methyldaidzein 
/(isoformononetin).
/
/The HI4'OMT of <i>Glycorrhiza echinata</i>, partially purified and separated from the D7OMT, clearly distinguish between 
/substrates, accepting only 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone but not daidzein |CITS: [12610212]|. The reaction product 
/2,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone is further dehydrated and gives rise to formononetin |CITS: [15734910]|. The 
/findings indicate that those enzymatic steps represent the biosynthetic sequence leading to 4'-methoxylated compounds,
/which altogether constitute ca 50% of naturally occurring isoflavonoids |CITS: [Dewick94]|.
/
/Medicarpin was also accepted as substrate from the HI4'OMT of <i>Glycorrhiza echinata</i>, expressing a specific 
/activity similar to that of (+)-6a-hydroxymaackiain 3-OMT of pea to (+)-medicarpin |CITS: [9349277]|. Therefore 
/comparable catalytic functions of these enzymes were concluded, which was corroborated by the high amino acid identity 
/(83%) with (+)-6a-hydroxymaackiain 3-OMT of pea |CITS: [Preisig89]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM3) has been identified and partially characterized 
/in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. MAM3, also known as MAM-L catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with 
/a series of &omega;-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic acids which are involved in the biosynthesis of the C3 to C8 
/aliphatic glucosinolates know to occur in Arabidopsis. This molecular function was confirmed by recombinant 
/expression and characterization of the enzyme in <i>E. coli</i> and complementation of MAM3 deficient mutants 
/of Arabidopsis that lack the range of long chain C6 to C8 glucosinolates. The enzyme in general expressed 
/broad substrate specificity towards substrates such as pyruvate and 2-oxoisovalerate converting them to 
/citramalate and 2-isopropylmalate, respectively. However, it has been demonstrated that this does not represent 
/an <i>in vivo</i> activity of the enzyme. MAM3 has been shown to be localized in chloroplasts |CITS: [17369439]|.

COMMENT - The gene encoding for SAM:benzoic acid-salicylic acid carboxymethyltransferase (AlBSMT1) has been 
/isolated from <i>Arabidopsis lyrata</i> using the AtBSMT1 primer pair from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. 
/The gene is orthologous to AtBSMT1 in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and was functionally expressed in 
/<i>E. coli</i>. Its functions as SAM:benzoic acid-salicylic acid carboxymethyltransferase (AlBSMT1) has 
/been demonstrated |CITS: [14617060]|. The enzyme belongs to the SABATH family |CITS: [DAURIA03]|. 
/AlBSMT1 is a homodimer of about 91 kDa. The pH optimum lies between 7 and 8.
/
/The substrate preference and catalytic efficiency of AlBSMT1 differs somewhat from its counterpart in 
/<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. While AtBSMT1 methylates salicylic acid with a 50% higher efficiency than 
/benzoic acid AlBSMT1 has a 24fold higher efficiency in converting benzoic acid than salicylic acid 
/|CITS: [14617060]|.

COMMENT - The gene of Arabidopsis (At5g48930) has been shown to encode the hydroxycinnamoyl-Coenzyme A 
/shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) both synthesizing and catabolizing the hydroxycinnamoylesters 
/(coumaroyl/caffeoyl shikimate and quinate) involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway |CITS: [12381722]|. 
/The function of the Arabidopsis gene was characterized by the observed effects of HCT gene repression by 
/RNA silencing. The resulting plants show a dwarf phenotype and sterility. The silencing of HCT leads to 
/altered soluble phenylpropanoid production, lignin content and composition (increased H units versus S units) 
/with a favored production of guaiacyl lignin. That could be demonstrated in silencing the corresponding gene 
/in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> since the dwarf phenotype and sterility of Arabidopsis did not allow to 
/gather enough tissue for in-depth investigation of the lignin polymer |CITS: [15161961]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the 4'-O-methylation of apigenin (apigenin 4'-O-methyltransferase) has been 
/partially purified and characterized from young seedlings of <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>. However, it 
/could be shown that organs of older plants such as roots and shoots as well as callus tissues exhibited 
/comparable methyltransferase activities. The apigenin 4'-O-methyltransferase expressed the highest 
/substrate specificity towards apigenin but also accepted caffeic acid, 5-hydroxy-caffeic acid, naringenin 
/and quercetin. The enzyme did not methylate p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid |CITS: [Kuroki81]|
/which was concluded to support the hypothesis that the B-ring methylation takes place at the C15-level 
/rather than the C9 (phenylpropanoid acid) level as proposed earlier |CITS: [EBEL70]|.

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding a novel plant-specific type III polyketide synthase (PKS), pentaketide chromone synthase (PCS) 
/was isolated from roots of <i>Aloe arborescens</i> and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli.</i> The purified protein 
/produces a single product, 5,7-dihydroxy-2-methylchromone, with malonyl-CoA as the sole substrate|CITS: [15686354]|. 
/Acetyl-CoA was also accepted but used with a much lower efficiency as reported for the aleosone synthase in rhubarb 
/|CITS: [15044020]|. Although the homodimeric enzyme accepts several other aromatic and aliphatic substrates as starter 
/units only malonyl-CoA results in the formation of the pentaketide chromone. Interestingly, a single mutation (Met207) 
/corresponding to the CHS-active site residue (Thr197) causes a dramatic change in the enzyme specificity. The mutant 
/enzyme produces octaketide instead of the pentaketide chromone which represents the first type III PKS catalyzing seven 
/successive polyketide chain elongation reactions |CITS: [15686354]| demonstrating the complexity of catalytic functions 
/and specificities of type III PKS's.

COMMENT - The enzyme activity of sorghum arogenate dehydratase requires a sulfhydryl reducing agent. It is strongly feedback 
/inhibited by phenylalanine, whereas stimulated by tyrosine. The Ki for phenylalanine is 24 uM, and the 
/K<sub>A</sub> for tyrosine is 2.5 uM. The enzyme has a higher affinity with these two effectors than with its 
/substrate arogenate. The other co-product, bicarbonate, has no effect on the enzyme activity. The optimum pH 
/of the enzyme activity is between 7.5 and 8.5.

COMMENT - Two cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases involved in late hydroxylation steps towards the formation of rosmarinic 
/acid have been identified in microsomes of <i>Coleus blumei</i>. It has been established through inhibitory studies that the 
/hydroxylation of the 3- and 3'-postion in the phenolic rings of 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate and derivatives is not 
/catalyzed by phenolases, potentially being able to carry out this reaction. In contrast, known cytochrome P450 inhibitors such 
/as cytochrome c, ancymidol, metyrapone, miconazole, juglone and tetcyclacis significantly decreased the enzymes activities. 
/The 4-coumaroyl-4'hydroxyphenyllactate 3-hydroxylase (4CHPL-3-H) catalyzes both the introduction of a hydroxyl group 
/in positions 3 of the aromatic ring in 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate forming caffeoyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate or  
/hydroxylates 4-coumaroyl-3',4'-dihydroxyphenyllactate generating rosmarinic acid. The consecutive action of a corresponding 
/3'-hydroxylase finally results either in the formation of RA (from 4-coumaroyl-3',4'-dihydroxyphenyllactate) or 
/caffeoyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate (from 4-coumaroyl-4'hydroxyphenyllactate), respectively. However, the order of introduction 
/of the 3- and 3'-hydroxyl groups could not be determined |CITS: [Petersen97]|.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase is considered to catalyze the first step in the retrieval 
/of isoflavone aglycons from the conjugate cycle. However, the liberation of malonic acid has not been reported in 
/<i>Spinacea oleracea</i> and <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> indicating that the malonylation of 7-O-glucosides may not 
/be mandatory for all plants |CITS: [4643301]|. The malonylesterase in chickpea is associated with the vacuolar 
/membrane |CITS: [Mackenbrock92]|, which may be the reason for the observed interference with the malonyltransferase 
/activity in crude extracts |CITS: [6497385]|.
/
/Nevertheless, the high specificity of the enzyme for isoflavone malonylglucoside 
/(e.g. biochanin A-7-O-glucoside-6"-O-malonate) adds to the body of evidence for an existing interconversion 
/isoflavone conjugate cycle.  
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase isolated from chick pea acts specifically with isoflavone 
/malonylglucosides and is different from unspecific (synthetic) acylhydrolases being active with naphtyl or phenyl 
/esters. 
/
/Ultrafiltration indicated a unusual high molecular weight around 300 kD, however it has been shown that the enzyme 
/aggregates with membrane material. SDS gel electrophoresis resulted in a single subunit of 32 kD |CITS: [3740841]|.
/It has been demonstrated, that the enzyme <i>in vivo</i> binds to membrane structures which may be necessary to achieve 
/full enzyme activity. 
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase is different from other plant esterases being insensitive 
/to most of the usual esterase inhibitors. However, Hg2+ and p-hydroxmercuribenzoate did efficiently inhibit the reaction, 
/suggesting that essential SH groups are required |CITS: [3740841]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme has stringent substrate specificity for both the sugar donor (UDP-glucose) and acceptor (IAA). ADP, 
/CDP, or GDP-glucose cannot be used as a sugar donor, nor does UDP-galactose or UDP-xylose. Substrates 
/having similar chemical structure as IAA, such as coumaric acid, cannot be used as the glucose acceptor.

COMMENT - The 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase (5-FCL) in Arabidopsis was identified using the sequence of the human 
/5-FCL for screening the Arabidopsis database. The monomeric Arabidopsis 5-FCL functionally complemented 
/a triple mutant of yeast lacking FCL activity and being disrupted in purine synthesis. The enzyme was recombinant 
/expressed in <i>E. coli</i> exhibiting a high activity of the Arabidopsis 5-FCL. The Arabidopsis FCL preferred the 
/pentaglutamyl form of 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (Km 5.8 uM) and was specific for the 6S isomer. Cell fractionation 
/in conjunction with immunoblotting revealed that the subcellular location of the 5-FCL is targeted to mitochondria 
/|CITS: [12207015]|. The 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase is the only enzyme known to metabolize 
/5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF). It also strongly inhibits the serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT)

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis genome has nine functional genes encoding acyl-CoA synthetase|CITS: [12177484]|. Genetic 
/and biochemical evidence have sorted physiological roles for some of them. LACS9 is the major chloroplast 
/acyl-CoA synthetase|CITS: [12177483]|. It contributes to the activation of de novo synthesized fatty acids during their 
/exporting from the chloroplast.  The enzyme is located on the chloroplast envelope. 
/Knockout mutant plants contain only 10% of the chloroplast long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity. 
/LACS9 is highly expressed in developing seeds and young rosette leaves.

COMMENT - Whisk fern (<i>Psilotum nudum</i>) contains a small family of 5 CHS/STS synthases, two of them representing 
/stilbene synthases which catalyze the formation of pinosylvin from malonyl-CoA and cinnamoyl-CoA. A cDNA 
/encoding a pinosylvin-forming synthase (PnL) was isolated from shoots of <i>Psilotum nudum</i> subsequently 
/recombinant expressed, purified and partly characterized in <i>E. coli.</i> The dimeric enzyme preferred cinnamoyl-CoA 
/but also could use p-coumaryl-CoA producing resveratrol and the derailment products bisnoryangonin (BNY) and 
/p-coumaroyltriacetic acid lactone (CTAL) (|FRAME:PWY-84|) being indicative for stilbene synthases |CITS: [11762173]|.

COMMENT - DNA encoding methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM3) has been identified and partially characterized 
/in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. MAM3, also known as MAM-L catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with 
/a series of &omega;-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic acids which are involved in the biosynthesis of the C3 to C8 
/aliphatic glucosinolates know to occur in Arabidopsis. This molecular function was confirmed by recombinant 
/expression and characterization of the enzyme in <i>E. coli</i> and complementation of MAM3 deficient mutants 
/of Arabidopsis that lack the range of long chain C6 to C8 glucosinolates. The enzyme in general expressed 
/broad substrate specificity towards substrates such as pyruvate and 2-oxoisovalerate converting them to 
/citramalate and 2-isopropylmalate, respectively. However, it has been demonstrated that this does not represent 
/an <i>in vivo</i> activity of the enzyme. MAM3 has been shown to be localized in chloroplasts |CITS: [17369439]|.

COMMENT - The monomeric UDPG: isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase isolated from <i>Cicer arietinum</i> expressed a specifically 
/high catalytic potential to glucosylate the 7-O-position of isoflavones bearing a hydroxyl or methoxyl group at the 
/para - position of the B-ring. 
/
/The 4'-O-methylated isoflavones (biochanin A, formononetin) are the preferred substrates followed by the 
/4'-O-hydroxylated isoflavones (daidzein, genistein) with compareable lower turnover rates. The glucosylation of 
/hydroxyl substitutes isoflavones, flavones, flavanones, flavanols, coumarins, cinnamic acids, and benzoic acids could
/not be catalyzed at all. 
/
/Biochanin A and formononetin are the main phenolic constituents in chick pea roots indicating that the 
/isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase may have been adapted in legumes in both a tissue and substrate specific manner.

COMMENT - Living organism possess two types of transhydrogenases (TH). The first type is the so called energy-linked transhydrogenase 
/catalyzing the NADH driven reduction of NADP and responding to the proton motive force across the membrane. The other 
/type, the non-energy-linked transhydrogenase catalyzes the NADPH driven reduction of NAD forming NADH and NADP 
/|CITS: [6840064]|. Two transhydrogenase activities were localized in the inside-out submitochondrial particles of potato tubers, 
/a diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) sensitive activity being associated to the complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase  - EC 1.6.5.3) 
/and a DPI insensitive activity specific for the 4B proton on NADH (EC 1.6.1.1) |CITS: [CARLENOR88]| |CITS: [10548498]|. 
/The latter is a non-energy-linked transhydrogenase showing similarities to the soluble non-energy-linked TH found in some bacteria. 
/The discovery of this TH activity has been discussed as a connector between the matrix NAD(H) and NADP(H) pools |CITS: [10548498]|.

COMMENT - A |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| dependent curcumin glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UCGGT) was identified, purified and catalytically characterized from |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| treated cultured cells of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>. The UCGGT transferred |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| with strict regioselectivity (1->6) to various flavonoid glucosides, hence biosynthesizing the respective gentioside derivatives. 
/
/UCGGT catalyzed the corresponding gentiobioside formation of the flavonol glucosides |FRAME:CPD1F-437 quercetin-3-glucoside|, |FRAME:CPD1F-453 kaempferol-3-glucoside| and |FRAME:CPD-14843 myricetin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside| and the flavone glucoside |FRAME: LUTEOLIN-7-O-BETA-D-GLUCOSIDE luteolin 7-<i>O</i>-glucoside|. The preferred activated sugar donor for the curcumin glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| but the enzyme also exhibited a relative activity of 26% towards |FRAME:CPD-14553 UDP-&alpha;-D-galactose| |CITS:[17940060]|.

COMMENT - The spinach phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEAMT) was isolated by complementation of a yeast mutant 
/(<i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe cho22</i>) lacking the first methyltransferase necessary for the synthesis of choline. 
/The enzyme expressed high activity towards phosphoethanolamine (PE) but did not methylate ethanolamine or 
/phosphatidylethanolamine. The monomeric PEAMT was able to catalyze all three methylation steps leading to phosphocholine. 
/The cDNA sequence comprised two similar, tandem methyltransferase domains with the N-terminal sequence sensitive for 
/the first methylation (phosphoethanolamine to monomethylphosphoethanolamine) and the C-terminal domain mediating 
/the remaining two. Salinization resulted in a 10-fold increase in PEAMT mRNA and an 8-fold higher PEAMT activity, 
/indicating that this enzyme is regulated on the gene expression level |CITS: [10799484]|.

COMMENT - DNA encoding methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM3) has been identified and partially characterized 
/in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. MAM3, also known as MAM-L catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with 
/a series of &omega;-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic acids which are involved in the biosynthesis of the C3 to C8 
/aliphatic glucosinolates know to occur in Arabidopsis. This molecular function was confirmed by recombinant 
/expression and characterization of the enzyme in <i>E. coli</i> and complementation of MAM3 deficient mutants 
/of Arabidopsis that lack the range of long chain C6 to C8 glucosinolates. The enzyme in general expressed 
/broad substrate specificity towards substrates such as pyruvate and 2-oxoisovalerate converting them to 
/citramalate and 2-isopropylmalate, respectively. However, it has been demonstrated that this does not represent 
/an <i>in vivo</i> activity of the enzyme. MAM3 has been shown to be localized in chloroplasts |CITS: [17369439]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding hydroxycinnamaldehyde dehydrogenase (HCALDH) was isolated from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 
/and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The ref1 (reduced epidermal fluorescence) mutants of Arabidopsis 
/lacking this gene accumulated significantly less of the usual amount of sinapate esters indicating the involvement 
/of this gene in the biosynthetic route leading to hydroxycinnamate esters. The recombinant protein from Arabidopsis 
/expressed both coniferaldehyde- and sinapaldehyde dehydrogenase activity resulting in the formation of ferulate and 
/sinapate, respectively. The function of the gene was demonstrated by functional complementation of the ref1 mutant 
/with the wild-type gene, restoring the original pattern of sinapate esters |CITS: [14729911]|. Aldehyde dehydrogenases 
/are expected to be di - or tetrameric |CITS: [12081471]| but no further experiments have been done to confirm the protein 
/structure for the Arabidopsis enzyme.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding the flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (CYP75B4) was isolated from <i>Perilla frutescens</i>. The enzyme 
/was recombinant expressed in yeast and its molecular function of hydroxylating the 3'position of the B-ring confirmed. 
/The hydroxylation of the flavonoid B-ring is important for determining the flower color. The enzyme hydroxylated naringenin 
/and apigenin forming eriodictyol and luteolin, respectively with comparable catalytic efficiency. Interestingly, the flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase 
/is predominantly present in red forms of <i>Perilla frutescens</i> indicating a different coordinated expression of genes 
/involved in flavones and anthocyanin biosynthesis in the two varieties of <i>Perilla</i> |CITS: [11773526]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding anthocyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside 2-<i>O</i>''-glucosyltransferase (Ip3GGT) was 
/isolated from young flower buds of <i>Ipomoea purpurea</i>. The enzyme adds glucose to anthocyanidin 3-glucosides 
/at the 2''-<i>O</i>-position of the glucose moiety forming the corresponding sophorosides.  Its molecular 
/function has been confirmed by recombinant expression of the protein in <i>E. coli</i>. In addition, the 
/Ip3GGT gene was introduced into Petunia plants causing an increase of cyaniding 3-O-sophoroside up to 
/80% of the total anthocyanidin content in dependence on the expression level of the gene. The enzyme 
/accepts all three major anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides, including delphinidin 3-O-glucoside as substrate 
/even though the latter has not been found in any morning glory species. In the contrary, the enzyme could 
/not convert anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucosides although they have been identified in dusky mutants of Ipomoea

COMMENT - Cell cultures of the old man cactus (<i>Cephalocereus senilis</i>) accumulate unusual B-ring unsubstituted flavonoids 
/upon elicitation, among them the aurone cephalocerone (|FRAME:CPD-7034|) |CITS: [Pare92]|. Two isoforms of chalcone 
/isomerase (CHI 1, CHI 2) exist in the cactus being able to convert both the 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone to naringenin 
/and 2',4',6'-trihydroxychalcone to pinocembrin. The existence of a hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase accepting both cinnamic 
/acid and p-coumaric acid and a chalcone synthase which catalyzes the formation of 2',4',6'-trihydroxychalcone from 
/cinnamoyl-CoA and 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone from p-coumaroyl-CoA complements the enzymes necessary for 
/the production of B-ring unsubstituted flavanoids in elicited or B-ring substituted flavonoid in unchallenged cell cultures of 
/<i>Cephalocereus senilis</i>. The CHI of chitin-elicited cell cultures was partially purified and its substrate specificity 
/towards 2',4',6'-trihydroxychalcone demonstrated |CITS: [7646065]|.

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis cardiolipin synthase has an alkaline pH optimum. It has an absolute requirement of 
/divalent cation. The Km for substrate CDP-DAG is distinctively lower than that for substrate 
/phosphatidylglycerol (PG). All these are typical properties of the mitochondrial cardiolipin synthase 
/from eukaryotes. 
/
/The Arabidopsis enzyme is less active with PG species carrying one or two palmitoyl groups than with 
/the dioleoyl species of PG. When dioleoyl species of PG and CDP-DAG were used as substrates, the 
/Kms for PG and CDP-DAG were 150 uM and 1.4 uM, respectively.

COMMENT - DNA encoding methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM3) has been identified and partially characterized 
/in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. MAM3, also known as MAM-L catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with 
/a series of &omega;-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic acids which are involved in the biosynthesis of the C3 to C8 
/aliphatic glucosinolates know to occur in Arabidopsis. This molecular function was confirmed by recombinant 
/expression and characterization of the enzyme in <i>E. coli</i> and complementation of MAM3 deficient mutants 
/of Arabidopsis that lack the range of long chain C6 to C8 glucosinolates. The enzyme in general expressed 
/broad substrate specificity towards substrates such as pyruvate and 2-oxoisovalerate converting them to 
/citramalate and 2-isopropylmalate, respectively. However, it has been demonstrated that this does not represent 
/an <i>in vivo</i> activity of the enzyme. MAM3 has been shown to be localized in chloroplasts |CITS: [17369439]|.

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase is a flavoprotein with a non-covalently bound FAD cofactor. In an in vitro assay, the enzyme was shown reacted with both L-galactono-1,4-lactone and L-gulono-1,4-lactone, and in both cases generated the product L-ascorbate. The enzyme was inhibited by the substrate L-galactono-1,4-lactone at concentrations above 2 mm (Ki = 16.4 mm). No substrate inhibition was found with the alternative substrate l-gulono-1,4-lactone at concentrations up to 100 mm.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was identified from a cDNA library of |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| induced <i>Catharanthus roseua</i> cultured cells. The cDNA was expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized with regard to molecular function and catalytic properties. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UGT3) was able to catalyze the 1,6-glucosylation of 
/|FRAME: LUTEOLIN-7-O-BETA-D-GLUCOSIDE luteolin 7-<i>O</i>-glucoside| to yield  |FRAME:CPD-14825 luteolin-7-<i>O</i>-gentiobioside|. 
/
/UGT3 only exhibited activity with |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| and catalyzed the 1,6-addition of |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| to another |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| molecule, hence forming gentiosides of varying length. UGT3 transcripts were only detected in leaves of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>.  The <i>in vivo</i> function of UGT3 as luteolin glucosyltransferase remains to be shown as luteolin gentiosides have not yet been reported from <i>Catharanthus</i> indicating another or additional function of the glucosyltransferase in xenobitics detoxification |CITS:[19561332]|.

COMMENT - An epithiospecifier protein (ESP) from Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Ler, has been purified after 
/heterologous expression in E. coli. Since the substrates of ESP, thiohydroximate-O-sulphonates, are 
/unstable, the activity of ESP was assayed with glucosinolates in the presence of myrosinase. The 
/Arabidopsis ESP catalyzes the conversion of alkenylglucosinolates to epithionitriles, whereas 
/nonalkenylglucosinolates were converted to simple nitriles. Aromatic benzylglucosinolates were not 
/substrates of ESP. 
/
/The Arabidopsis ESP is completely inactive in citrate and phosphate buffers. The highest activity was 
/found in Mes buffer at pH 6.0. Both Fe2+ and Fe3+ are co-factors that promote ESP activity. The 
/optimum concentration of Fe2+ is 0.5 mM. Chelators of Fe2+ or Fe3+, such as bathophenanthroline 
/disulfonic acid and deferoxamine, strongly inhibit ESP activity. ESP activity is completely blocked by 
/addition of 2 mM EDTA. On the other hand, the enzyme activity is increased by addition of 
/dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol. 
/
/It was also observed that without ESP, myrosinase and Fe2+ are sufficient to convert glucosinolates 
/to simple nitriles.

COMMENT - Two cDNA's from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (AtAAPT1, AtAAPT2) have been isolated from an Arabidopsis cDNA 
/library using the AAPT cDNA from soybean as a heterologous hybridization probe. Both cDNA's encode 
/aminoalcoholphosphotransferases involved in the nucleotide pathway of the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)
/and phosphatidylcholine (PC) as demonstrated by gene expression in yeast mutants lacking those enzyme activities. 
/It has been demonstrated that both AtAAPT1 and AtAAPT2 convert CDP-ethanolamine and CDP-choline into the 
/corresponding phopsphatidylalcohols although with slight differences regarding the substrate preference. AtAAPT2 
/showed a higher preference for CDP-choline over CDP-ethanolamine in comparison to AtAAPT1 and was also 
/inhibited to a lesser degree by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Cytidine monophosphate (CMP) than AtAAPT1 |CITS: [Goode99]|. Both 
/enzymes (AtAAPT1, AtAAPT2) were able to catalyze the reverse reaction supporting the proposal that diacylglycerol, 
/involved as substrate in both PC and triacylglycerol biosynthesis (|FRAME:TRIGLSYN-PWY|), is in equilibrium with 
/PC and maintains this equilibrium via the reversibility of the cholinephosphotransferase reaction |CITS: [Slack85]|. 
/AtAAPT1 and AtAAPT2 seem to represent the only aminoalcoholphosphotransferases in Arabidopsis as concluded
/from the Southern blotting patterns. Both polypetides contain seven membrane spanning regions as shown by their 
/hydropathy files. This finding is in agreement with other AAPT's isolated so far and confirms their localization in 
/membranes |CITS: [Goode99]|.

COMMENT - Similar to PLD alpha, PLD epsilon was active under a reaction condition with 50 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. At micromolar concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, PLD epsilon required oleic acid for activity. The highest activity of PLD epsilon was towards phosphatidylcholine, followed by phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The activity with phosphatidylserine was low.

COMMENT - Both columbamine and tetrahydrocolumbamine are good substrates for the C. japonica enzyme, indicating palmatine biosynthesis can proceed via either columbamine or tetrahydropalmatine, at least in C. japonica. The enzyme substrate specificity is different from that reported from Berberis. The Berberis wilsoniae enzyme is highly substrate specific|CITS: [Rueffer86]|. Only columbamine, not tetrahydrocolumbamine, served as the substrate.

COMMENT - Little information on plant cytosolic MDH is known. cDNA of a cytosolic MDH was isolated from alfafa. The cDNA was expressed in E. coli and the recombinant protein purified and assayed |CITS: [9721676]|. The enzyme specificity constant (Kcat/Km) was calculated for the forward and reverse reactions and indicated a 5-fold higher specificity for malate synthesis. This is different from the wheat cytosolic MDH which was indicated to have a 28-fold higher specificity for malate synthesis |CITS: [15388227]|.

COMMENT - The gene of Arabidopsis (At5g48930) has been shown to encode the hydroxycinnamoyl-Coenzyme A 
/shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) both synthesizing and catabolizing the hydroxycinnamoylesters 
/(coumaroyl/caffeoyl shikimate and quinate) involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway |CITS: [12381722]|. 
/The function of the Arabidopsis gene was characterized by the observed effects of HCT gene repression by 
/RNA silencing. The resulting plants show a dwarf phenotype and sterility. The silencing of HCT leads to 
/altered soluble phenylpropanoid production, lignin content and composition (increased H units versus S units) 
/with a favored production of guaiacyl lignin. That could be demonstrated in silencing the corresponding gene 
/in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> since the dwarf phenotype and sterility of Arabidopsis did not allow to 
/gather enough tissue for in-depth investigation of the lignin polymer |CITS: [15161961]|.

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis gene At2G37940 (ERH1), encoding an inositolphosphorylceramide synthase (IPCS) was heterologously expressed in a yeast AUR1 mutant (an IPCS knock-out). ERH1 was shown to be able to substitute the yeast AUR1. The enzyme activity of the heterologously expressed ERH1 was further assayed in vitro, using a microsome preparation from the yeast transfromants. IPCS activity was detected with either dihydrosphingosine- or phytosphingosine-containing ceramides as substrates. The enzyme activities with sphingosine-containing ceramides were however very low.   
/
/The in planta role of ERH1 was investigated using an Arabidopsis ERH1 knockout mutant.  A 50% reduction of IPCS activity was found in the mutant when compared to the wild type. The remaining IPCS activities detected in the mutant could be attributed to the two ERH1 homologs in the Arabidopsis genome, At2G29525 and At3G54020.

COMMENT - The sinapoylglucose:sinapoylglucose sinapoyltransferase (SST) of <i>Raphanus sativus</i> was partially purified 
/from cotyledons of 5 day old, dark-grown seedlings. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of 1,2-di-O-&beta;-sinapoylglucose 
/and was shown to follow a random bi-bi mechanism |CITS: [Dahlbender86]|. This sinapoyl ester accumulates in 
/dark-grown seedlings while the production of sinapoylmalate is markedly decreased under such conditions. This 
/has been discussed as a 'disproportionation' reaction, channeling the 1-sinapoylglucose towards 1,2-disinapoylglucose 
/formation in place of the biosynthesis of sinapoylmalate, the main sinapoyl ester in light-grown seedlings at this stage 
/of development |CITS: [STRACK84]|.

COMMENT - The enzymatic activity of a <i>trans-cis</i> isomerase converting the <i>trans</i>-configured |FRAME: CPD-459|
/into its <i>cis</i>-isomer |FRAME: CPD-7417| has been found in aqueous extracts 
/of <i>Melilotus alba</i>. The existence of an isomerase system was further supported by the fact that plants 
/exposed to dark or light did not significantly differ with regard to their coumarin content indicating that the 
/conversion to the confirmed <i>cis</i>-isomeric precursor for the &beta;-glucosidase appears not to occur 
/spontaneously |CITS: [5836500]|.

COMMENT - Nonleguminous plants isomerize only 6'-hydroxychalcone to 5-hydroxyflavanone (referred to as Typ I) whereas 
/leguminous plants convert both 6'-deoxychalcone and 6'-hydroxychalcone to 5-deoxyflavanone and 5-hydroxyflavanone 
/(referred to as Typ II). 
/
/In <i>Lotus japonicus</i> three isoenzymes (plus a putative fourth isoenzyme) have been identified to carry out the 
/cyclization of the 6'hydroxy- and 6'deoxychalcones towards flavanones and isoflavones, representing enzymatic 
/activities of both types.
/
/Vmax (nkat x mg-1) for LjCHI1 was 2.500 (naringenin chalcone) and 1.030 (isoliquiritigenin), respectively. 
/The apparent Km for naringenine chalcone was 3 uM  and for isoliquiritigenin 4 uM, with an pH optima of 7.5 to 8.0.

COMMENT - The ethanolamine N-methyltransferase (EAMT) isolated from castor bean endosperm expressed a high affinity towards 
/ethanolamine, indicating that this substrate represents the starting compound for the conversion of free-base intermediates 
/leading to free choline |CITS: [PRUDHOMME92B]|. Moreover, pulse-chase labeling experiments also confirmed the 
/increasing incorporation of radioactivity (<sup>14</sup>C-S-adenosyl-L-methionine) over time in the other free-base intermediates,
/dimethylethanolamine and choline |CITS: [PRUDHOMME92A]|. Whether or not one or more enzyme(s) (EAMT's) are 
/involved in the formation of choline or if those enzyme(s) participate in any of the N-methylation steps on either the 
/phospho-base or phosphatidyl-base level still needs to be addressed |CITS: [PRUDHOMME92B]|.

COMMENT - Arabidopsis genome has nine functional genes encoding acyl-CoA synthetase. LACS6 and LACS7 are peroxisome-located. The substrate specificity of the two acyl-CoA synthetases was further characterized with heterologously expressed proteins. The results indicate that both enzymes are capable to activate the naturally occurring fatty acids stored in the Arabidopsis seeds. 
/
/LACS6 has similar activities towards fatty acids with chain length of C14 to C18. The activities towards medium chain length (from C6 to C12) are 25% to 50% less compared to C14.

/Only prephenate, oxaloacetate, and 2-ketoglutarate are effective keto-acid substrates. 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate

/co-substrates. The maximum enzyme activity was observed with prephenate concentrate between 0.5 and 1 mM, 
/with glutamate as the co-substrate. The enzyme is substrate inhibited by high concentrations of prephenate 
/(greater than 1 mM). The substrate inhibition effect is overcome by increasing concentration of the co-substrate 
/glutamate. The enzyme has an unusual high optimum temperature of 70 <sup>o</sup>C.

COMMENT - The final and diverse step in the formation of the molybdenum cofactor (moco) in plants is catalyzed by a 
/bifunctional two-domain protein (Cnx1). The Cnx1G domain has been demonstrated to bind molybdopterin 
/and catalyze the adenylated molybdopterin-AMP (MPT-AMP) intermediate |CITS: [15504727]| that is finally 
/converted to moco by the insertion of molybdenum (Mo). This part of the reaction is catalyzed by the Cnx1E 
/domain. The Cnx1E domain from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> has been purified and recombinant expressed 
/in <i>E. coli</i>. The recombinant protein was able to hydrolyze MPT-AMP. The cleavage of MPT-AMP is 
/carried out in a Zn2+ or Mg2+-dependent and molybdate enhanced manner. It has been proposed that molybdate 
/oxygen promotes the cleavage |CITS: [16636046]|. The following insertion of Mo2+ coincides with the release 
/of Cu2+ that has been shown to be bound to the molybdopterin dithiolate sulphur |CITS: [15306815]|. It seems 
/that copper itself is not involved in the Mo insertion but plays a protective function during moco synthesis 
/|CITS: [16636046]|.

COMMENT - The gene encoding flavanone 7-O-glucoside-2"-O-rhamnosyltransferase (C12RhaT) has been isolated from 
/pummelo (<i>Citrus maxima</i>). The molecular function could be demonstrated in transgenic BY2 tobacco cells 
/where the recombinant protein converted 7-O-glucose flavanone to their corresponding 2"-rhamnosides. The 
/specific attachment of L-rhamnose to the C-2 of the glucose moiety determines the bitter taste specific for those 
/plants versus the tasteless <i>Citrus</i> species where L-rhamnose is attached to the C-6 of glucose |CITS: [15361143]|. 
/(1-2)-Rhamnosyltransferase activities in <i>Citrus</i> have been shown to be dependent on developmental stages 
/and are especially high in juvenile plants |CITS: [12232031]|. The enzyme has been purified to homogeneity

COMMENT - In plants the multifunctional two-domain protein Cnx1 catalyzes the last step of the molybdenoum cofactor 
/(moco) biosynthesis, the insertion of molybdenum (Mo) into molybdopterin. The first step, the formation of 
/adenylated molybdopterin (MPT-AMP) is carried out by the Cnx1G domain expressing MPT-adenylyltransferase 
/activity |CITS: [15504727]|. The Cnx1G protein has been purified from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and recombinant 
/expressed in <i>E. coli</i> demonstrating its ability to bind MPT with high affinity. Cnx1 as well as the Cnx1G 
/domain alone was able to complement <i>E. coli</i> mutants (mogA) being incapable to carry out the final 
/step in moco biosynthesis |CITS: [9341109]|. Investigation of the crystal structure of the enzyme defined the 
/binding site for MPT as a large surface depression that discriminates between MPT binding and catalysis 
/|CITS: [11554796]|. Those findings confirmed the published reaction mechanism and function of Cnx1G 
/|CITS: [12590921]| |CITS: [10823911]|. Further research with crystal structures of Cnx1G/molybdopterin 
/complexes revealed the involvement of copper bound to the dithiolate sulphur of MPT that is released after 
/Mo insertion |CITS: [15306815]|. The MPT-AMP synthesis appears to be the rate-limiting step in Cnx1 reaction 
/considering the large difference between the Km of ATP dependent MPT-AMP formation (Km 62 uM) and the 
/hydrolysis of this complex (Kd 0.1 uM) |CITS: [15504727]|.

COMMENT - The dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase/dihydropterin synthase (HPPK/DHPS) from <i>Pisum sativum</i> was isolated 
/from leaf mitochondria. The enzyme is bifunctional and combines activities catalyzing two consecutive steps to form 
/7,8-dihydropteroate from 6-hydroxymethyl-dehydropterin. HPPK/DHPS has a native molecular weight of 280 - 300 kDa 
/with identical subunits of 53 kDa, hence probably existing as a hexamer. The fact that enzyme activity could only be 
/detected in mitochondria and that a mitochondrial transit peptide was required for synthesis pointed to mitochondria as 
/the unique site of 7,8-dihydropteroate synthesis in plants. Mg<sup>2+</sup> was essential to the function of the 
/dihydropterin synthase domain of the enzyme |CITS: [9118956]|.

COMMENT - Arabidopsis plants accumulate scopoletin, predominantly in roots. The feruloyl-CoA 6'-hydroxylase, a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase encoded by At3G13610, is involved in scopoletin synthesis. Severe reduction in the levels of scopoletin was found in the roots of At3G13610 mutants |CITS: [18547395]|. 
/
/Recombinant At3G13610 protein was expressed in E. coli, and was soluble. In vitro assay indicated that feruloyl-CoA was a good substrate. No enzyme activity was detected with ferulic acid |CITS: [18547395]|.

No enzyme activity was detected with ferulic acid. Unlike AT3G13610 which is required for scopoletin biosynthesis, the biological role of At1G55290 is unknown. No impact on scopoletin level in roots was found in At1G55290 mutants |CITS: [18547395]|.

COMMENT - The enzymatic activity of an anthocyanin 3'-<i>O</i>-glucosyltransferase (3'GT) was identified in the crude 
/extract from petals of <i>Clitoria ternatea</i>. The enzyme did glucosylate the 3'-position of the B-ring of 
/delphinidin 3-<i>O</i>-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside to form the corresponding 3'-<i>O</i>-&beta;-glucoside. The 
/anthocyanin composition of mauve flower color mutants of Clitoria that could not produce ternatins and 
/therefore lacked the blue color revealed that those plants only accumulated delphinidin 3-<i>O</i>-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside. 
/Enzyme preparations of the mauve line did not glucosylate delphinidin 3-<i>O</i>-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside 
/or its 3'-<i>O</i>-glucoside derivative indicating that those plants had lost 3'GT and 5'-GT activity |CITS: [Kazuma04]|. 
/It is not clear whether the glucosylation of the 3' and 5'-position of 3-<i>O</i>-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside is 
/catalyzed by two different glucosyltransferases (3'GT and 5'GT) or one enzyme glucosylating both positions.

COMMENT - The gene of Arabidopsis (At5g48930) has been shown to encode the hydroxycinnamoyl-Coenzyme A 
/shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) both synthesizing and catabolizing the hydroxycinnamoylesters

/The function of the Arabidopsis gene was characterized by the observed effects of HCT gene repression by 
/RNA silencing. The resulting plants show a dwarf phenotype and sterility. The silencing of HCT leads to 
/altered soluble phenylpropanoid production, lignin content and composition (increased H units versus S units) 
/with a favored production of guaiacyl lignin. That could be demonstrated in silencing the corresponding gene 
/in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> since the dwarf phenotype and sterility of Arabidopsis did not allow to 
/gather enough tissue for in-depth investigation of the lignin polymer |CITS: [15161961]|.

COMMENT - Malonyl CoA: anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-4'''-O-malonyltransferase (SsMaT2) the enzyme that catalyzed the 
/regiospecific 4"'malonylation of monodemalonylsalvianin and |FRAME:CPD-7708| with high efficiency was 
/purified from open flowers of <i>Salvia splendens</i>. In addition, the molecular function of the enzyme was 
/confirmed by recombinant expression of the isolated cDNA in <i>E. coli</i>. The enzyme did not malonylate 
/bisdemalonylsalvianin indicating the difference to the malonyltransferase catalyzing the first malonylation in 
/salvia. The amino acid sequence of SsMaT2 lacked a sequence specific for anthocyanin acetyltransferases 
/(AATs) and was found to be more related to acetyl-CoA:benzylalcohol acetyltransferase (BEAT), hence 
/evolving from a different branch of the BAHD family. The specificity of the enzyme was shown by the strong

COMMENT - The enzyme activity of N. silvestris arogenate dehydratase is inhibited by phenylalanine and activated by tyrosine. 
/The maximum activation was observed at 0.25 mM of tyrosine. Zn<sup>2+</sup> or Cu<sup>2+</sup> at 2.5 mM 
/completely abolished the enzyme activity, and Co<sup>2+</sup> reduced the activity by 50%, whereas 
/Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> had no effects at the same concentration.  
/
/The optimum temperature is 32 <sup>o</sup>C. The optimum pH is between 8.5 and 9.5.

COMMENT - Both columbamine and tetrahydrocolumbamine are good substrates for the C. japonica enzyme, indicating palmatine biosynthesis can proceed via either columbamine or tetrahydropalmatine, at least in C. japonica. The enzyme substrate specificity is different from that reported from Berberis. The Berberis wilsoniae enzyme is highly substrate specific|CITS: [Rueffer86]|. Only columbamine, not tetrahydrocolumbamine, served as the substrate.

COMMENT - A coniferin specific &beta;-glucosidase (CBG) was isolated and purified to homogeneity from differentiating xylem of 
/<i>Pinus contorta</i> |CITS: [7724669]|. The corresponding cDNA has been isolated and recombinant expressed in 
/<i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [10412914]|. Based on sequence similarity this enzyme belongs to the family 1 glycosyl hydrolases 
/group of proteins. An N-terminal signal peptide sequence suggests that CGB is a secretory protein targeted to the 
/ER. The monomeric enzyme is a glucoprotein and was most specific in the hydrolysis of the 4-O-glucosidic linkage 
/of coniferin, syringin and chromogenic compounds being analogs to coniferin (e.g. 2-nitrophenyl-&beta;-glucoside). The 
/enzyme activity was exclusively found in the differentiating xylem indicating its potential role in lignin biosynthesis.

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis genome has nine functional genes encoding acyl-CoA synthetase|CITS: [12177484]|. 
/Genetic and biochemical evidence have sorted physiological roles for some of them. LACS6 and LACS7 
/are peroxisome-located. The substrate specificity of the two acyl-CoA synthetases was further 
/characterized with heterologously expressed proteins|CITS: [12366803]|. The results indicate that both enzymes are 
/capable to activate the naturally occurring fatty acids stored in the Arabidopsis seeds. LACS6 has 
/similar activities towards fatty acids with chain length of C14 to C18. The activities towards medium 
/chain length (from C6 to C12) are 25% to 50% less compared to C14. LACS7 is more active than 
/LACS6. LACS7 has similar activities towards fatty acids with chain length of C14 to C18. Its activity 
/with C18:1 fatty acid is 2-3 times higher than with the rest of long chain fatty acids. The activities 
/towards medium chain length (from C6 to C12) are 25% to 50% less compared to C14.

COMMENT - The 6a-hydroxylation of maackiain leading to 6a-hydroxymaackiain in <i>Pisum sativum</i> is catalyzed by an enzyme, which
/is still under investigation. It has been shown that the root rot fungus <i>Nectria haematococca</i> detoxifies maackiain 
/by 6a-hydroxylation of this pterocarpan's B-ring |CITS: [Matthews87]|. The enzyme was characterized as an oxygenase 
/incorporating oxygen to the 6a-position directly from O2.
/
/In contrast the 6a-hydroxylation carried out in pea does not incorporate oxygen from O2 but from water |CITS: [Matthews87]|.
/This result led to the conclusion that pisatin biosynthesis does not involve 6a-hydroxylation by an oxygenase. An alternative 
/pathway, where sophorol is converted directly to 6a-hydroxymaackiain by an enzyme-catalyzed rearrangement has 
/been proposed |CITS: [Matthews87]|, but awaits further research.
/
/It has been demonstrated that the last enzyme of the pathway, the 6a-hydroxymaackiain-3-O-methyltransferase 
/(HMKMT) clearly prefers the (+) over the (-)-enantiomer of 6a-hydroxymaackiain  |CITS: [9349277]|. The change in 
/stereochemistry, from the isolated (-)-enantiomers in pea of the likly precursors (maackiain, sophorol) for 6a-hydroxylation 
/leading to the (+)-enantiomer of 6a-hydroxymaackiain is discussed to be catalyzed by a (unknown) epimerase |CITS: [Dixon95]|,
/or the addition of water across a pterocarpene double bond with subsequent inversion of stereochemistry |CITS: [8037464]|.
/The proposed epimerization must occur prior to hydroxylation as this reaction proceeds with retention of configuration
/ |CITS: [2505672]| |CITS: [6540173]| |CITS: [Banks82a]|.
/
/At present, the experimental data obtained so far point to a enzyme different from the 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 
/6a-hydroxylase (D6aH) involved in gluceollin biosynthesis. This enzyme has been well characterized as an 
/P450-dependent monooxygenase |CITS: [2505672]|.

COMMENT - SMT3 is highly homologous to |FRAME:AT1G20330-MONOMER|, acts on the same substrate and exhibits similar but distinguishable expression patterns, suggesting that the two proteins are functionally redundant |CITS:12215504|.  This is supported by the fact that when expressed in SMT2-mutant <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants, SMT3 rescues the mutant phenotype. At the time of this review, no specific enzymatic data is available concerning this protein.

COMMENT - A |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| dependent curcumin glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UCGGT) was identified, purified and catalytically characterized from |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| treated cultured cells of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>. The UCGGT transferred |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| with strict regioselectivity (1->6) to various flavonoid glucosides, hence biosynthesizing the respective gentioside derivatives. 
/
/UCGGT catalyzed the corresponding gentiobioside formation of the flavonol glucosides |FRAME:CPD1F-437 quercetin-3-glucoside|, |FRAME:CPD1F-453 kaempferol-3-glucoside| and |FRAME:CPD-14843 myricetin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside| and the flavone glucoside |FRAME: LUTEOLIN-7-O-BETA-D-GLUCOSIDE luteolin 7-<i>O</i>-glucoside|. The preferred activated sugar donor for the curcumin glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| but the enzyme also exhibited a relative activity of 26% towards |FRAME:CPD-14553 UDP-&alpha;-D-galactose| |CITS:[17940060]|.

COMMENT - NAD kinases are ubiquitously present in all organisms and catalyze the synthesis of NADP from NAD and ATP. Two 
/isoforms of NAD kinase have been detected in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The cDNA encoding for NAD kinase (NADK2) 
/was cloned and its molecular function confirmed by expression of the recombinant enzyme in <i>E. coli</i>. NADK2 
/represents an isozyme which activity depends on the binding of calmodulin (CaM) which could be demonstrated in the 
/native, partially purified enzyme. Moreover, a calmodulin-binding domain was detected in the N-terminal extension of 
/NADK2. This findings indicate that both CaM-dependent and -independent NADKs exist in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The 
/transcripts of NADK2 were found in roots, shoots, leaves and flowers of <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The partially purified enzyme 
/from <i>Arabidopsis</i> demonstrated better kinetic efficiency (Km NAD = 200 uM, Km Mg2+-ATP = 170 uM) than the 
/recombinant isoform and was inhibited by EDTA and the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine |CITS: [15247403]|.

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding a pinosylvin synthase was isolated from wound and elicitor induced seedlings of <i>Pinus sylvestris.</i> 
/The dimeric protein was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and characterized. The enzyme expressed high activities 
/towards cinnamoyl-CoA and dihydrocinnamoyl-CoA and was first thought to represent a dihydropinosylvin synthase 
/rather than a pinosylvin synthase |CITS: [1536925]|. However, it was later shown from the same group that there was 
/no special stilbene synthase for the formation of dihydropinosylvin but rather a high affinity for dihydrocinnamoyl-CoA 
/of the pinosylvin synthase |CITS: [1426272]|. The substrate preference was still superior for cinnamoyl-CoA which 
/determined the enzyme as pinosylvin synthase.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-4'-O-methyltransferase (I4'OMT), catalyzing specifically the 4'-O-methylation of isoflavones is 
/considered to be the last enzymatic step in 4-methoxyisoflavone biosynthesis. The natural occurrence of such 
/4-methoxylated compounds (formononetin, biochanin A) as main constituents in chick pea makes this plant an 
/attractive object for the I4'OMT as the 4'-O-methylation has not yet been unambiguously demonstrated. 
/
/The IOMT's isolated from various legumes had a pronounced specificity for the methylation of the 7-hydroxyl group of 
/daidzein or genistein <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [11752378]|, indicating that the IOMT catalyzing the formation of formononetin 
/or biochanin A must differ from those O-methyltransferases. 
/
/The partially purified enzyme from <i>Cicer arietinum</i> was the first to be reported to convert both daidzein and genistein 
/to the corresponding 4'-O-methylester, in contrast to other potential compounds involved in the isoflavone pathway 
/that were not transformed at all |CITS: [4452353]|.
/
/However, it has been shown in further experiments, using improved separation techniques, that the reaction product of
/this reaction was most probably the 7-O-methylester. The separation of both 4'- and 7-O-methylester was only 
/achieved in one specific solvent system |CITS: [Hagmann84]|, and the 7-O-methylester could be confirmed by 
/two-dimensional HPTLC.

COMMENT - The enzyme, partially purified from seeds of <i>Brassica napus</i>, revealed a dimeric structure on SDS-PAGE, with 
/a dominant 28 kDa subunit. However, even after 5000 fold purification the enzyme could not be purified to apparent 
/homogeneity and displayed several polypeptide bands on SDS gelelectrophoresis. The enzyme demonstrated a broader 
/pH optimum between 6.6 and 7.2. No glucan side chain could be detected on the purified enzyme. The kinetic data with
/the <i>Brassica napus</i> enzyme show varying Km values in the high uM range for both sinapoylglucose and choline 
/in dependence on the concentration of each substrate. That is consistent with an ordered ping-pong mechanism, where 
/the glucose ester first binds to the active side of the enzyme followed by binding the choline cation after glucose is 
/released |CITS: [8382030]|.

COMMENT - The
/purified maize starch phosphorylase equally catalyzes the reaction in
/both directions in an in-vitro assay with amylopectin as the
/substrate. The optimum pH for the degradation direction is between 5.5
/and 7.0. The optimum pH for the synthetic direction is between 5.5 and
/6.5. The optimum temperature is 40 <sup>o</sup>C. When
/malto-oligosaccharides were provided as the substrate, the enzyme
/activity is greater towards the degradation direction.  In-vivo, the
/direction of the reaction may be determined by the relative
/concentration of phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate.

COMMENT - In vitro assay with purified recombinant PCS1 protein showed that the soy bean enzyme had the highest activity (1210 pkat/ug) catalyzing the synthesis of phytochelatin when glutathione was the sole substrate. PCS1 had a very low activity (2.2 pkat/ug) in homophytochelatin synthesis when homoglutathione was the sole substrate. The enzyme activity in homophytochelatin (hPC2) synthesis was increased almost 100-fold (to 210 pkat/ug) when both glutathione and homoglutathione were provided as substrates (at 0.5 mM and 10 mM, respectively). This indicated that glutathione acts as the &gamma;-glutamylcysteine unit donor molecule and that homoglutathione acts as the acceptor molecule during the synthesis of homophytochelatin |CITS: [11706029]|.  
/
/The enzyme activity in the synthesis of either phytochelatin or homophytochelatin requires absolute presence of metal ions. Among the metal ions tested, the highest enzyme activity was found in the presence of 0.5 mM Cd2+ |CITS: [11706029]|.

COMMENT - 7,2'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-isoflavanone (DMI) dehydratase is the enzyme closing the dihydrofuran ring by catalyzing 
/the  removal of water from the isoflavanol intermediate. It is not clear, whether the dehydratation takes place via 
/carbonium cation or  quinone methide intermediates |CITS: [7805842]|, hence both possibilities are displayed.
/
/This specific enzyme activity has been overlooked, most probably because the conversion of the intermediate to the 
/final pterocarpan occurs spontaneously even under mild acid treatment  |CITS: [8071365]|.
/
/DMI dehydratase have been found to be loosely associated with vestitone reductase, indicative of a weak 
/protein-protein interaction |CITS: [7805842]|, which would minimize the need for diffusion of the more unstable 
/isoflavonol intermediate.
/
/The DMI dehydratase has a very similar molecular weight, which is another reason, that the enzyme was not separated
/in earlier experiments. It has also been demonstrated that both enzymes, vestitone reductase and DMI dehydratase, 
/are co-induced upon elicitation underlining the enzymatic cooperation in this final step of the pterocarpan biosynthesis 
/|CITS: [7805842]|.

COMMENT - Myrosinase was purified to homogeneity from Raphanus sativus (daikon) seedlings. The purified 
/myrosinase activity is ascorbate-dependent. The enzyme is almost totally inactive in the absence of 
/ascorbate. Ascorbate enhances the enzyme activity more than 100-fold. Activation by ascorbate showed 
/linear 'uncompetitive activation'. However, ascorbate concentration greater than 500 uM inhibits the 
/enzyme. The product sulphate is a competitive inhibitor, having Ki of 60 mM with respect to the 
/substrate sinigrin.  
/
/The Km for substrate sinigrin, an allyl glucosinolate, ranges from 23 uM to 500 uM depending on the 
/absence/presence of ascorbate. 
/
/The myrosinase from daikon also has a beta-glucosidase activity when tested with 
/p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside. Ascorbate is also an uncompetitive activator of the 
/beta-glucosidase activity.

COMMENT - The MAM1 gene in Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia encodes a methylthioalkylmalate synthase which is able to condense 
/2-oxo-4-methylthiobutanoic acid with acetyle-CoA to form 2-(2'-methylthio)ethylmalic acid, when expressed in 
/E.Coli. The corresponding MAM1 allele in ecotype Landsberg is however not able to catalyze the same reaction. 
/The condensation reaction must be catalyzed by a different gene in Landsberg.
/
/The MAM1-encoded methylthioalkylmalate synthase catalyzes the condensation reactions of only the first two rounds of 
/methionine chain elongation in the biosynthesis of methionine-derived glucosinolates. The enzyme 
/requires a divalent metal ion and ATP (or ADP) for activity.
/
/The optimum pH is 8.5. The enzyme requires a divalent metal ion, such as Mn++, for activity.

COMMENT - Two genetic loci controlling flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3',5'H) in <i>Petunia x hybrida</i>, i.e. Hf1 and Hf2 
/have been analyzed and the corresponding cDNA's isolated. Hf2 was found to control the F3',5'H activity only 
/in the limb but not in the tube of the flower. The molecular function of the cDNA was confirmed by recombinant 
/expression of the enzyme in yeast being able to 3',5'-hydroxylate naringenin and dihydroquercetin to form 
/pentahydroxyflavanone (via eriodictyol - |CITS: [10476065]|) and dihydromyricetin, respectively. In addition, the complementation of the F3',5'H gene 
/was demonstrated based upon a color change in transgenic petunia expressing the sense construct of the 
/F3',5'H cDNA |CITS: [8232589]|.

COMMENT - The naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT), catalyzing the final step in the biosynthesis of sakuranetin 
/has been isolated and purified from UV-irradiated leaves of <i>Oryza sativa</i>. Sakuranetin and its catalyzing 
/enzyme are only found in stressed tissues of rice indicating that the enzyme is synthesized <i>de novo</i>. 
/The induction of NOMT correlates well with the level of accumulated sakuranetin and follows a time-dependent 
/pattern |CITS: [8651913]|. The NOMT accepts other flavanones such as luteolin and apigenin but not isoflavanones, 
/dihydroflavonols and phenylpropanoid acids, e.g. caffeic acid. Although NOMT exhibits an even more efficient 
/turnover of luteolin it is not considered to be luteolin specific since that compound is not found in rice 
/|CITS: [10814825]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding the anthocyanin 3-O-glucoside-6"-O-acyltransferase (3-AT) was isolated from leaves of 
/<i>Perilla frutescens</i> and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The recombinant enzyme catalyzed 
/the 3-aromatic acylation with caffeic and p-coumaric acid for both anthocyanidin 3- glucosides and 
/anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucosides |CITS: [10845463]|. The purified enzyme from <i>Perilla frutescens</i> leaves 
/prefers the monoglucosylated anthocyanins over the diglucosylated anthocyanins with only little effect regarding 
/the number of hydroxyl groups on the B-ring |CITS: [Fujiwara98]|. The enzyme was significantly inhibited 
/after applying diethylpyrocarbonate and N-ethylmaleimide to the incubation indicating that histidine and cysteine 
/residues are important for the activity |CITS: [10845463]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding for the anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5-GT) in <i>Perilla frutescens</i> was 
/isolated and recombinant expressed in yeast. The molecular function was shown to express 
/anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase activity converting anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside to anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucoside. 
/The best <i>in vitro</i> substrate was cyanidine 3-O-glucoside followed by delphinidin 3-O-glucoside and 
/pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside. Some activity was also observed towards anthocyanidin-3-O-acylglucoside. The 
/investigation of red and green forms of <i>Perilla frutescens</i> revealed that the 5-GT gene was specifically 
/expressed in the leaves of the red form, but not in those of the green form. The expression of the 5-GT gene 
/was induced by illumination with white light. |CITS: [10066805]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM3) has been identified and partially characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. MAM3, also known as MAM-L catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with a series of ?-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic acids which are involved in the biosynthesis of the C3 to C8 aliphatic glucosinolates know to occur in Arabidopsis. This molecular function was confirmed by recombinant expression and characterization of the enzyme in E. coli and complementation of MAM3 deficient mutants of Arabidopsis that lack the range of long chain C6 to C8 glucosinolates. The enzyme in general expressed broad substrate specificity towards substrates such as pyruvate and 2-oxoisovalerate converting them to citramalate and 2-isopropylmalate, respectively. However, it has been demonstrated that this does not represent an in vivo activity of the enzyme. MAM3 has been shown to be localized in chloroplasts |CITS: [17369439]|.

COMMENT - The tomato Asc-1 was able to partially complement the yeast lag1&Delta;lac1&Delta; double mutant. In yeast, Lag1p and Lac1p are essential for the sphinganine N-acyltransferase activities. It indicated that Asc-1 encodes a sphinganine N-acyltransferase in tomato. In a ratio tracer assay, the tomato asc-1 mutant was shown to have reduced sphingolipid biosynthesis that was accompanied with an elevated level of free long chain bases. This further supports the proposed function of Asc-1 as a sphinganine N-acyltransferase.

COMMENT - Two cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases involved in late hydroxylation steps towards the formation of rosmarinic 
/acid have been identified in microsomes of <i>Coleus blumei</i>. It has been established through inhibitory studies that the 
/hydroxylation of the 3- and 3'-postion in the phenolic rings of 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate and derivatives 
/is not catalyzed by phenolases, potentially being able to carry out this reaction. In contrast, known cytochrome P450 
/inhibitors such as cytochrome c, ancymidol, metyrapone, miconazole, juglone and tetcyclacis significantly decreased the 
/enzymes activities. The hydroxycinnamoyl-4'hydroxyphenyllactate 3'-hydroxylase (H4HPL-3'-H) catalyzes both the 
/introduction of a hydroxyl group in positions 3' of the aromatic ring in 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate forming 
/4-coumaroyl-3',4'-hydroxyphenyllactate or  hydroxylates caffeoyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate generating rosmarinic acid. 
/The consecutive action of a corresponding 3-hydroxylase finally results either in the formation of 4-coumaroyl-3',4'-dihydroxyphenyllactate 
/(from 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate) or RA (from caffeoyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate), respectively. However, the 
/order of introduction of the 3- and 3'-hydroxyl groups could not be determined |CITS: [Petersen97]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding hydroxycinnamaldehyde dehydrogenase (HCALDH) was isolated from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 
/and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The ref1 (reduced epidermal fluorescence) mutants of Arabidopsis 
/lacking this gene accumulated significantly less of the usual amount of sinapate esters indicating the involvement 
/of this gene in the biosynthetic route leading to hydroxycinnamate esters. The recombinant protein from Arabidopsis 
/expressed both coniferaldehyde- and sinapaldehyde dehydrogenase activity resulting in the formation of ferulate and 
/sinapate, respectively. The function of the gene was demonstrated by functional complementation of the ref1 mutant 
/with the wild-type gene, restoring the original pattern of sinapate esters |CITS: [14729911]|. Aldehyde dehydrogenases 
/are expected to be di - or tetrameric |CITS: [12081471]| but no further experiments have been done to confirm the protein 
/structure for the Arabidopsis enzyme.

COMMENT - A |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| dependent curcumin glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UCGGT) was identified, purified and catalytically characterized from |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| treated cultured cells of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>. The UCGGT transferred |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| with strict regioselectivity (1->6) to various flavonoid glucosides, hence biosynthesizing the respective gentioside derivatives. 
/
/UCGGT catalyzed the corresponding gentiobioside formation of the flavonol glucosides |FRAME:CPD1F-437 quercetin-3-glucoside|, |FRAME:CPD1F-453 kaempferol-3-glucoside| and |FRAME:CPD-14843 myricetin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside| and the flavone glucoside |FRAME: LUTEOLIN-7-O-BETA-D-GLUCOSIDE luteolin 7-<i>O</i>-glucoside|. The preferred activated sugar donor for the curcumin glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| but the enzyme also exhibited a relative activity of 26% towards |FRAME:CPD-14553 UDP-&alpha;-D-galactose| |CITS:[17940060]|.

COMMENT - The following genetic evidence indicated that the Arabidopsis gene At4G04930 encodes a sphingolipid delta4 desaturase. First, At4G04930 was able to complement a year <i>P. pastoris</i> sphingolipid delta4 desaturase knock-out mutant. Second, floral tissues of Arabidopsis At4G04930 knock-out mutants were completely devoid of delta4 desaturated long chain bases in glucosylceramides, when compared to the wild type.

COMMENT - The enzyme showed distinct substrate specificity. Comparing to O-acetyl-serine, the activities toward O-succinyl-serine and O-sulpho-serine are trivial. No activity was found towards O-phospho-serine or serine. Comparing to pyrazole, the activities toward 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and N-hydroxyurea are trivial. The enzyme cannot synthesize mimosine, willardiine or isowillardiine.  The Km for O-acetyl-serine is less than that reported for mimosine synthase from Leucaena leucocephala.

COMMENT - The At5g17050 gene has been found to encode a flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 
/introducing a glucose group to the 3-position of the flavonoid C-ring. The gene was induced in response to plants 
/overexpressing the PAP1 gene encoding an MYB transcription factor. Homozygote mutants bearing T-DNA 
/insertions of the gene did not produce the protein and were found to contain significantly less anthocyanins than 
/the wild type. The molecular function was confirmed by expressing recombinant proteins in <i>E. coli</i>. The 
/enzyme accepted both anthocyanidins (cyanidin, pelargonidin and delphinidin) and flavonols (kaempferol, quercetin 
/and myricetin) and converted them to the corresponding 3-O-glucosides.  The enzyme also accepted flavonoids 
/which have not been found in Arabidopsis (delphinidin, myricetin) |CITS: [15807784]|.

COMMENT - Overexpression of UGT73C5 in Arabidopsis led to brassinosteroid-deficient phenotypes. Feeding the UGT73C5-overexpressing plants with brassinosteroids castasterone (CS) and brassinolide (BL) caused a two orders of magnitude increase of 23-O-glucosides of CS and BL. The results suggested a role of glucosylation by UGT73C5 in BR homeostasis.

COMMENT - TThe cDNA encoding the anthocyanin 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) in <i>Vitis vinifera</i> attaching a 
/glucose moiety to the 3-position of the C-ring was isolated and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. 
/The purified, recombinant enzyme expressed a high affinity towards flavonol and anthocyanidin substrates. 
/However, a comparison of the UFGT acitivity obtained from two <i>Vitis vinifera</i> varieties, one with 
/white berries and the other one having red berries demonstrated that the enzyme is not responsible for the 
/glucosylation of flavonols <i>in planta</i> despite its ability to do so <i>in vitro</i>. Hence, the true natural 
/substrates for the UFGT are anthocyanidins produced in the red grapes. The glucosylation reaction was strongly 
/inhibited by Cu <sup>2+</sup> but it has been found that Cu<sup>2+</sup> acts rather on the anthocyanidin 
/substrates (bleaching, structure change) than on the enzyme itself |CITS: [9535914]|.

COMMENT - 7,2'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-isoflavanone (DMI) dehydratase is the enzyme closing the dihydrofuran ring by catalyzing 
/the  removal of water from the isoflavanol intermediate. It is not clear, whether the dehydratation takes place via carbonium
/cation or  quinone methide intermediates  |CITS: [7805842]|, hence both possibilities are displayed.
/
/This specific enzyme activity has been overlooked, most probably because the conversion of the intermediate to the 
/final pterocarpan occurs spontaneously even under mild acid treatment |CITS: [8071365]|.
/
/DMI dehydratase have been found to be loosely associated with vestitone reductase, indicative of a weak 
/protein-protein interaction |CITS: [7805842]|, which would minimize the need for diffusion of the more unstable 
/isoflavonol intermediate.
/
/The DMI dehydratase has a very similar molecular weight, which is another reason, that the enzyme was not separated
/in earlier experiments. It has also been demonstrated that both enzymes, vestitone reductase and DMI dehydratase, 
/are co-induced upon elicitation underlining the enzymatic cooperation in this final step of the pterocarpan biosynthesis

COMMENT - ACOS5 (At1g62940) encodes a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. Mutant plants are severely compromised in pollen wall formation. In vitro substrate competition assay indicated that ACOS5 is a medium- to long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase with a preference for substituted fatty acids carrying a hydroxyl group at position C8 to C16. 
/
/Among the saturated fatty acids, ACOS5 showed clear preference for those of medium-chain length (C10 to C14), which competed nearly as well as oleic acid, whereas fatty acids of longer or shorter chain length competed less efficiently. 
/
/Among the hydroxy-octanoic acids, 8-hydroxy octanoic acid (8OH-C8) competed better than oleic acid whereas 2OH-C8 and 3OH-C8 were inactive. 
/
/Among the long-chain hydroxy fatty acids tested, 12OH-C18 and 16OH-C16 were the most efficient competitors, the latter exceeding the apparent effectiveness of oleic acid, whereas medium-chain hydroxy fatty acids (10OH-C10 and 12OH-C12) were again less active.

COMMENT - Over-expression of the DGAT cDNA in wild type Arabidopsis seeds and assaying for the DGAT activity using homogenized seeds with three C14-labeled acyl-CoA indicated that 18:1-CoA, 18:2-CoA, and 20:1 CoA can all be utilized as acyl donors. The Arabidopsis DGAT activity has the highest substrate specificity with 20:1-CoA followed by 18:1-CoA and 18:2-CoA. When equal amounts of 20:1-CoA and 18:2-CoA were supplied together, the DGAT activity for 20:1-CoA was twice as much as for 18:2-CoA.

COMMENT - The At5g17050 gene has been found to encode a flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 
/introducing a glucose group to the 3-position of the flavonoid C-ring. The gene was induced in response to plants 
/overexpressing the PAP1 gene encoding an MYB transcription factor. Homozygote mutants bearing T-DNA 
/insertions of the gene did not produce the protein and were found to contain significantly less anthocyanins than 
/the wild type. The molecular function was confirmed by expressing recombinant proteins in <i>E. coli</i>. The 
/enzyme accepted both anthocyanidins (cyanidin, pelargonidin and delphinidin) and flavonols (kaempferol, quercetin 
/and myricetin) and converted them to the corresponding 3-O-glucosides.  The enzyme also accepted flavonoids 
/which have not been found in Arabidopsis (delphinidin, myricetin) |CITS: [15807784]|.

/apparent catalytic activities to the eugenol O-methyltransferase (EOMT1), another COMT like methyltranferase. 
/However, CVOMT1 is more restricted in its substrate preference than EOMT and specifically catalyzes the 
/methylation of chavicol. The CVOMT1 has a pH optimum between 7 and 8 and represents a homodimer (87 kDa)

COMMENT - Substrate specificity was determined for the recombinant petunia enzyme. Out of 20 common L-amino acids tested as amino donors, only aspartate and glutamate supported the conversion of prephenate to arogenate. Among seven keto acids tested, only prephenate, &alpha;-ketoglutarate, and oxaloacetate were accepted as substrate |CITS: [21102469]|. 
/
/The petunia enzyme also catalyzed the reverse reaction, from arogenate to prephenate, but the catalytic efficiency was ten-fold lower that that of the forward reaction |CITS: [21102469]|.

COMMENT - Overexpression of UGT73C5 in Arabidopsis led to brassinosteroid-deficient phenotypes. Feeding the UGT73C5-overexpressing plants with brassinosteroids castasterone (CS) and brassinolide (BL) caused a two orders of magnitude increase of 23-O-glucosides of CS and BL. The results suggested a role of glucosylation by UGT73C5 in BR homeostasis.

COMMENT - Purification procedure of the cucumber enzyme showed a major activity peak of 66 kDa and a minor peak of 12.6 kDa. The minor peak was speculated of being a peptide fragment during the purification which retained the catalytic activity domain. The enzyme activity was not affected by EDTA and many metal ions, except that Ca2+ is significantly inhibitory. The enzyme has a narrow optimum pH of 6.2. Very little activity can be detected above pH 6.5.

COMMENT - The UDPG:coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferase (CAGT) was isolated and partially purified from developing xylem of 
/<i>Pinus strobus</i>. The enzyme has been purified from actively lignifying tissues as the accumulation of coniferin, 
/i.e. the highest activity of the CAGT coincides with events of wood formation such as the appearance of differentiated 
/tracheids undergoing secondary-wall formation and lignification |CITS: [Savidge98]| |CITS: [11430981]|. The partially 
/purified enzyme expressed high affinities towards coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol, as well as for their aldehydes and 
/dihydroconiferyl alcohol. The CAGT from <i>Pinus strobus</i> only accepts <i>trans</i>-configured substrates forming 
/the corresponding E-glucosides in contrast to the Z-glucosides found in <i>Fagus grandifolia</i> |CITS: [11537477]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding anthocyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside 2-<i>O</i>''-glucosyltransferase (Ip3GGT) was 
/isolated from young flower buds of <i>Ipomoea purpurea</i>. The enzyme adds glucose to anthocyanidin 3-glucosides 
/at the 2''-<i>O</i>-position of the glucose moiety forming the corresponding sophorosides.  Its molecular 
/function has been confirmed by recombinant expression of the protein in <i>E. coli</i>. In addition, the 
/Ip3GGT gene was introduced into Petunia plants causing an increase of cyaniding 3-O-sophoroside up to 
/80% of the total anthocyanidin content in dependence on the expression level of the gene. The enzyme 
/accepts all three major anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides, including delphinidin 3-O-glucoside as substrate 
/even though the latter has not been found in any morning glory species. In the contrary, the enzyme could 
/not convert anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucosides although they have been identified in dusky mutants of Ipomoea

COMMENT - The methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase :methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (DHY/CYC) was isolated 
/and purified to apparent homogeneity from leaves of <i>Pisum sativum</i>. It was demonstrated that this protein
/was readily separated from the 10-formyl-tetrahydrofoalate synthetase (SYN), indicating that plants possess two 
/proteins (bifunctional DHY/CYC activity, monofunctional SYN activity) to catalyze the interconversion of THF 
/derivatives |CITS: [12223808]| |CITS: [KIRK95]|. This finding clearly distinguishes the plant enzymes from the 
/trifunctional C1-THF synthetase complex observed in mammalians and yeast. The enzyme was found to be 
/located in the cytosol. The DHY/CYC is discussed to provide equilibrium between the pools of one-carbon units 
/at the formyl and methylene levels of oxidation. The cDNA encoding the DHY/CYC was isolated by using antibodies 
/raised against the purified cytosolic enzyme and screening a cDNA expression library from leaf extracts of pea 
/|CITS: [CHEN99]|.

Arginine was the most efficiently transported substrate. Nonetheless, in addition to arginine uniprot and arginine/arginine exchange, BAC2 was shown to have ornithine/ornithine exchange activity, as well as L-arginine/L-citrulline or L-arginine/other basic amino acids exchange activities |CITS: [16730327]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding for the anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5-GT) in <i>Perilla frutescens</i> was 
/isolated and recombinant expressed in yeast. The molecular function was shown to express 
/anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase activity converting anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside to anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucoside. 
/The best <i>in vitro</i> substrate was cyanidine 3-O-glucoside followed by delphinidin 3-O-glucoside and 
/pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside. Some activity was also observed towards anthocyanidin-3-O-acylglucoside. The 
/investigation of red and green forms of <i>Perilla frutescens</i> revealed that the 5-GT gene was specifically 
/expressed in the leaves of the red form, but not in those of the green form. The expression of the 5-GT gene 
/was induced by illumination with white light. |CITS: [10066805]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding benzophenone synthase (BPS) was isolated from cell-cultures of <i>Hypericum androsaemum</i> 
/|CITS: [12795704]|. The enzyme was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and characterized. The homodimeric 
/enzyme expressed a high affinity towards benzoyl-CoA with only minor activities for related compounds, such as 
/3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA |CITS: [12795704]| |CITS: [9459298]| and non at all for activated cinnamic acids. BPS belongs 
/to the superfamily of plant polyketide synthases (PKSs type III) that functionally differ from chalcone synthases (CHSs). 
/However, the CHS isolated from Hypericum androsaemum can attain BPS activity with relative ease using site-directed

COFACTORS - CU+2
COMMENT - A cDNA coding for a copper amine oxidase was cloned from etiolated pea seedlings. The cDNA was heterologously expressed in yeast (<i>Pichia pastoris</i>). Enzyme activity with putrescine as the substrate was only found in the yeast culture medium, which indicated an extracellular location of the pea enzyme. The enzyme activity was irreversibly inhibited by phenylhydrazine, a quinoprotein inhibitor, which suggested that a quinone cofactor, presumably TPQ (topa quinone), was required. The enzyme activity also required Cu2+ ion. In the absence of Cu2+, the enzyme activity was only 3% of that produced in medium containing 50 uM CuSO4. The requirement of TPQ and Cu2+ for the pea enzyme activity is the same as what was reported for copper amine oxidases in microorganisms and animals.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a chalcone synthase (PSCHS) accepting and converting both p-coumaroyl-CoA (to naringenin 
/chalcone) and cinnamoyl-CoA (to pinocembrin chalcone), respectively was isolated from plantlets of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>. 
/The enzyme reached almost 70% of the controls activity (p-coumaroyl-CoA = 100%) when cinnamoyl-CoA was used 
/as substrate. The CHS was constitutively expressed but was transiently increased upon stress. The homodimeric enzyme 
/contains a leucine zipper motif which is discussed as a necessity for the dimerization of the subunits. Concomitant 
/experiments with a CHS isolated from <i>Sinapis alba</i> indicates that the enzyme has this substrate specificity even 
/in plants not producing pinocembrin. The findings are discussed as an indication for the existence of two CHS's but there 
/is no further research done yet to substantiate the assumption |CITS: [1536925]|.

COMMENT - A dihydroxyacetone phosphate transaminase activity was detected in a crude sugarcane leaf protein extract. The enzyme requires pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. In addition to alanine, glutamate, aspartate and glutamine all served well as the amino donor.  Dihydroxyacetone could not replace dihydroxyacetone phosphate as the amino acceptor. Among all known transaminases, dihydroxyacetone phosphate transaminase is most similar to histidinol phosphate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.9) in that both enzymes use a keto phosphate as the amino acceptor and cannot use the keto alcohol as a substrate |CITS: [16660234]|.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase is considered to catalyze the first step in the retrieval 
/of isoflavone aglycons from the conjugate cycle. However, the liberation of malonic acid has not been reported in 
/<i>Spinacea oleracea</i> and <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> indicating that the malonylation of 7-O-glucosides may not 
/be mandatory for all plants |CITS: [4643301]|.
/
/Nevertheless, the high specificity of the enzyme for isoflavone malonylglucoside 
/(e.g. biochanin A-7-O-glucoside-6"-O-malonate) adds to the body of evidence for an existing interconversion 
/isoflavone conjugate cycle.  
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase isolated from chick pea acts specifically with 
/isoflavone malonylglucosides and is different from unspecific (synthetic) acylhydrolases being active with naphtyl or 
/phenyl esters. 
/
/Ultrafiltration indicated a unusual high molecular weight around 300 kD, however it has been shown that the enzyme 
/aggregates with membrane material. SDS gel electrophoresis resulted in a single subunit of 32 kD |CITS: [3740841]|.
/It has been demonstrated, that the enzyme <i>in vivo</i> binds to membrane structures which may be necessary to achieve 
/full enzyme activity. 
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase is different from other plant esterases being insensitive 
/to most of the usual esterase inhibitors. However, Hg2+ and p-hydroxmercuribenzoate did efficiently inhibit the reaction, 
/suggesting that essential SH groups are required |CITS: [3740841]|.

COMMENT - Arabidopsis has six acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX) genes. In vitro enzyme assays have determined substrate 
/specificities for ACX1 (long chain), ACX2 (very-long chain), ACX3 (medium chain) and ACX4 
/(short chain).  In vivo studies of enzyme activities using each ACX mutants confirmed in-vitro 
/results |CITS: [15743450]|. In vivo, ACX1 is primarily responsible for C16-C20 substrates, ACX3 for 
/C12 and C14, and ACX4 for C4 and C6.
/
/Expressing ACX1 in E. coli followed by enzyme assay indicated that ACX1 is active with both 
/medium- and long-chain acyl-CoAs. The activity with mono-unsaturated acyl-CoAs is slightly higher 
/than with saturated. ACX1 showed maximum activity with C14-CoA. In vivo study of ACX1 mutant 
/indicated ACX1 is primarily responsible for C16-C20 substrates.
/
/The Km for C14-CoA is 5.3 uM.

COMMENT - The enzyme glucosylating both the A-ring 4'-position of the 6'-deoxychalcone butein and the A-ring 6-position 
/of the 4-deoxyaurone sulfuretin has been isolated from petals of <i>Coreopsis grandiflora</i>. The resulting 
/products butein 4'-glucoside and sulfuretin 6-glucoside, respectively are both present in the plant and contribute 
/to the yellow flower coloration. In contrast to the corresponding enzyme characterized in <i>Dahlia variabilis</i> 
/|CITS: [Stich94]| the 6'-deoxychalcone 4'-glucosyltransferase (6'DC4'GT) of <i>Coreopsis grandiflora</i> did 
/only poorly use isoliquiritigenin as a substrate. The 6'-deoxychalcone 4'-glucosyltransferase (6'DC4'GT) did not 
/accept chalcones of the 6'-hydroxy-type but glucsylated the flavanones naringenin, eriodictyol and the flavones 
/apigenin and luteolin at the flavonoid A-ring 7-O-position |CITS: [Halbwirth97]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonol 7-<i>O</i>-glucosyltransferase (AtGT-2) was isolated from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. 
/Its molecular function of attaching glucose to the 7-<i>O</i>-position of the A-ring was confirmed as recombinant 
/protein expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The enzyme preferred to glucosylate the 7-<i>O</i>-position of flavonols such 
/as kaempferol, quercetin and isorhamnetin, the flavanone naringenin or the flavones luteolin and apigenin and even
/the isoflavonoids genistein and daidzein. However, the enzyme also glucosylated the 3-<i>O</i>-position of the 
/flavonols with a about 20fold lower efficiency. As a minor product flavonol 3,5-diglucosides (kaempferol, quercetin, isorhamnetin) 
/were identified <i>in vitro</i> indicating that the enzyme may also be able to 3-<i>O</i>-glucosylate 7-<i>O</i>-glucosylated 
/flavonol derivatives |CITS: [14697269]|. In contrary to the reported substrate specificity of this enzyme another author 
/reported the characterization of an enzyme encoded by the same locus (At4g34135) that has been specific for the 
/3-<i>O</i>-position (C-ring) of flavonols, flavanones and flavones but also had a lower affinity to glucosylate the 
/7-<i>O</i>-position (A-ring) of kaempferol and quercetin |CITS: [Kim06]|. The reversed position preference of the 
/two reported enzymes originating from the same locus remains to be validated. 
/Additional information: The Arabidopsis locus At4g34135 consists of two splice variants (At4g34135.1 and At4g34135.2)

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was identified from a cDNA library of |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| induced <i>Catharanthus roseua</i> cultured cells. The cDNA was expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized with regard to molecular function and catalytic properties. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UGT3) was able to catalyze the sequential sugar chain elongation of |FRAME:CPD-14838 (+)-sesaminol 2-<i>O</i>-&beta;-<i>D</i>-glucoside| to yield, over time, |FRAME:CPD-14839 (+)-sesaminol 2-<i>O</i>-&beta;-<i>D</i>-gentiobioside| and |FRAME:CPD-14841 (+)-sesaminol 2-<i>O</i>-&beta;-<i>D</i>-gentiotrioside|. 
/
/UGT3 only exhibited activity with |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| and catalyzed the 1,6-addition of |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| to another |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| molecule, hence forming gentiosides of varying length. UGT3 transcripts were only detected in leaves of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>.  The <i>in vivo</i> function of UGT3 as sesaminol glucosyltransferase remains to be shown as sesaminol and its gentiosides have not yet been reported from <i>Catharanthus</i> indicating another or additional function of the glucosyltransferase in xenobitics detoxification |CITS:[19561332]|.

COMMENT - Starting from 4-coumaryl-CoA and malonyl-CoA the biosynthesis of glyceollin involves nine enzymatic steps, which 
/have all been characterized |CITS: [Grisebach89]|. The final steps in the pathway to glyceollin involve prenylation and 
/cyclization of prenyl residue.
/
/The membrane-bounded dimethylallylpyrophosphate: trihydroxypterocarpan dimethylallyl transferase (DMAPP 
/prenyltransferase) carries out the prenylation of 3,6a,9-trihydroxypterocarpan to produce glyceollidin I and II in 
/comparable biosynthetic steps to the formation of phaseollins |CITS: [Zahringer79]| |CITS: [Zahringer81]|. Based on the 
/enzymatic yield of the two isomers (2- and 4-dimethylallyl-trihydroxypterocarpans) and their natural occurrence in 
/soybean plants the existence of two prenyltransferases has been proposed |CITS: [Zahringer81]|,  a finding which could 
/not be corroborated to date.
/
/The limited distribution of prenyltransferases has resulted in a smaller number of plants being able to synthesize complex 
/isoflavonoids. The prenylated pterocarpans are even restrictively distributed throughout the legumes |CITS: [Tahara95]|.
/The presence of prenyltransferases was demonstrated in white lupine |CITS: [443825]| and bean |CITS: [Biggs87]| 
/producing both induced (e.g. bean) and constitutive (lupine) antifungal complex isoflavonoids involved in the plant's 
/defense response.
/
/The soybean enzyme has been partially purified using different detergents enabling to carry out a refined study on the 
/enzyme's properties. Three detergents, Chaps, dodecylmaltoside (DOM) and 1-dodecyl-2-deoxy-phosphatidylcholine 
/(ES12H) were used and gel permeation chromatography of solubilized prenyltransferase eluted  molecular weights of 
/440 000 in DOM, 300 000 in ES 12H and above 1.500 000 in Chaps |CITS: [Welle91]|.
/
/It was shown that the homoallylic isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) was not just unable to replace 
/dimethylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP) but was in addition an efficient competitive inhibitor (Ki = 7.5 uM) of prenyltransferase 
/activity  |CITS: [Welle91]|.
/
/The intracellular location of prenyltransferases involved in both glyceollin (soybean) and phaseollin (bean) biosynthesis 
/has been pinpointed to the chloroplast inner envelope membrane using sucrose- and Percoll-gradient centrifugation. 
/In conclusion a movement of isoflavonoid intermediates between cell membranes was proposed, where the di- and 
/trihydroxylated pterocarpans (DHP, THP) are transferred to the plastids for prenylation and returned to the endoplasmatic 
/reticulum for subsequent cyclization |CITS: [Biggs90]| |CITS: [Grisebach89]|.

COMMENT - In vascular plants and cyanobacteria, the concerted action of PDS and ZDS results in the formation of 
/7,7',9,9'-tetra-cis-lycopene (prolycopene), which must be isomerized to all-trans lycopene before it 
/can be cyclized by lycopene cyclases |CITS: [12399171]|. The gene encoding the enzyme responsible 
/for this isomerization (CRTISO) has been cloned from L. esculentum |CITS: [11884678]| and A. thaliana |CITS: [11884677]|. 
/CRTISO has significant similarity to bacterial phytoene desaturases (CrtI), which catalyze all necessary 
/steps for the direct formation of trans-lycopene from phytoene. |CITS: [15568974]|

COMMENT - &beta;-chloro-L-alanine is an effective alternative substrate of L-cysteine. O-sulpho-L-serine and L-cystine can also substitute L-cycsteine, at a much less extent. O-acetyl-L-serine is a poor substitute of L-cysteine showing only 1.8% of the enzyme activity towards L-cysteine. There is no detectable activity towards O-phospho-L-serine, L-serine, D-cysteine, or O-acetyl-D-serine. In addition to &beta;-cyanoalanine, the enzyme can also synthesize &beta;-(pyrazole-1-yl)-L-alanine, &beta;-(3-amino-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-L-alanine with a lower activity compared to the synthesis of &beta;-cyanoalanine. The enzyme cannot synthesize willardiine, isowillardiine, mimosine, or O-ureido-L-serine.

COMMENT - Mutant metabolite profiling data, as well as in vitro enzyme assay data, indicated enzyme activity with indolylmethylglucosinolate. Only 4-hydroxy-3-indolylmethylglucosinolate was detected as a product in the enzyme assay. The accumulation of 4-hydroxy-3-indolylmethylglucosinolate was significantly less in the CYP81F2 knockout mutant. 
/Neither 1-hydroxy-3-indolylmethylglucosinolate nor its further methylated product 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethylglucosinolate was affected in the mutant, suggesting another enzyme is responsible for the analogy reaction converting indolylmethylglucosinolate to 1-hydroxy-3-indolylmethylglucosinolate.

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis genome has a small gene family of three members encoding 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, KAT1, KAT2 and KAT5. Only KAT2 gene is expressed at a significant level during seed germination and seedling growth. Knock-out mutants of KAT2 accumulated long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs in developing seedlings indicating KAT2 encoded 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase plays an indispensable role in fatty acid breakdown. The enzyme activity of KAT2 was confirmed by expressing KAT2 in E. coli followed by characterization of the purified recombinant protein. The Km for acetoacetyl-CoA is 77.5 uM.

COMMENT - The final reaction in the biosynthetic route towards pterocarpans is to form the dihydrofuran ring. That includes the 
/reduction of the second chiral center (11a) of the isoflavanone C-ring and the subsequent loss of water completing 
/the closure of the ether ring. 
/
/This last step in the conversion of isoflavanoles to pterocarpanes was thought to be carried out by a single enzyme 
/(pterocarpan synthase - EC 1.1.1.246 - |CITS: [Bless88]|). However, the reaction was determined to include two 
/independent enzyme activities |CITS: [8071365]| |CITS: [7805842]|, one to reduce vestitone to an 4-hydroxy-isoflavanol 
/intermediate (vestitone reductase) and another one to catalyze the water loss (DMI hydratase).
/
/Vestitone reductase is a monomeric enzyme with a strict stereo specificity for the 3R-isoflavanones. Both vestitone 
/reductase and DMI dehydratase have been found to be loosely associated, indicative of a weak protein-protein 
/interaction |CITS: [7805842]|, which would minimize the need for diffusion of the more unstable isoflavonol intermediate.
/
/The vestitone reductase was cloned from alfalfa and expressed and characterized in E. coli. It appears to be a 
/single-copy or low-copy number gene |CITS: [7625843]|. The tissue-specific expression of vestitone reductase 
/transcripts in alfalfa indicates an analogous induction pattern to that of isoflavone reductase, which suggests that the 
/pterocarpan specific pathway could be regulated in the same manner.
/
/Vestitone reductase is an monomeric, cytosolic enzyme not being associated to the endoplasmatic reticulum. The 
/enzyme was immunolocalized in fungal lesions of leaf cells, in mature and young roots, and in nodule meristems |CITS: [LopezMeyer02]|

COMMENT - The Sophora flavescens N8DT-1 encodes a flavanone prenyltransferase that acted on naringenin, liquiritigenin and hesperetin. Flavonols or isoflavones were not prenylated.  Dimethylallyl diphosphate was the only accepted prenyl donor.  The enzyme activity was strictly dependent on Mg2+ |CITS: [18218974]|. 
/
/N8DT-2 shares 93% amino acid identity with N8DT-1. It exhibited the same enzyme properties as N8DT-1 (details were not reported in the original paper |CITS: [18218974]|).

COMMENT - Isoflavanones formed from isoflavones represent the last isoflavonoid intermediates in the biosynthesis of pterocarpans 
/|CITS: [Dewick94]|. The soluble, monomeric enzyme catalyzing this step, isoflavone reductase (IFR), also determines the 
/stereochemistry of the final pterocarpans. 
/
/The chickpea IFR requires a 2'-hydroxyl group and either a 4'-methoxy or 4',5'-methylendioxy substitution on the 
/B-ring of the isoflavones |CITS: [Tiemann87]| |CITS: [1915347]|. The isoflavones 2'-hydroxyformononetin and 
/2'-hydroxypseudobaptigenin involved in the biosynthesis of medicarpin and maackiain, respectively, are converted to
/their corresponding (3R)-isoflavanones, hence introducing chirality into the pterocarpan molecules. 
/
/The stereospecifity of this reaction has been investigated in cell suspension cultures of Cicer arietinum, suggesting 
/that the enzyme catalyzes the trans-addition from HA of NADPH to the C-2 atom of 2'-hydroxyformonetin yielding an 
/isoflavanone (3R-vestitone) with opposite absolute configurations |CITS: [Schlieper90]|.
/
/The partially purified enzyme of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> |CITS: [Tiemann87]| had a temperature optimum of 35 to 
/40 centigrade.

COMMENT - OPCL1 (At1g20510) is a 4-coumarate-CoA ligase-like member of the acyl-activating enzyme gene family in Arabidopsis. Recombinant OPCL1 was shown to accept substrates OPC-8, OPDA and medium to long chain fatty acids. It does not have activity towards hydroxycinnamates involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism. OPCL1 mutant had significantly reduced JA accumulation in response to wounding. Conversely, the level of its substrate, OPC-8, was significantly increased. It indicates that OPCL1 plays a physiological role in wound-induced JA synthesis |CITS: [16963437]|.

COMMENT - The phenylalanine aminomutase (PAM) was isolated and purified to apparent homogeneity from cell cultures of <i>Taxus chinensis</i>. Peptide sequences of the purified enzyme was used to obtain the PAM cDNA clone which was heterogously expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The recombinant enzyme was demonstrated to catalyze the conversion of the only accepted substrate &alpha;-L-phenylalanine to form &beta;-phenylalanine. The native enzyme was determined as a homodimer consisting of two 80 kDa dimers. The native enzyme exhibited a rather slow conversion indicating that PAM is one of the rate-limiting enzymes of the taxol biosynthesis. The enzyme carried out the reaction without need of cofactors and was shown to process the reaction through 4-methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO) which is expected to be catalytic electrophile. The protein described here was very similar to the phenylalanine aminomutase from <i>Taxus cuspidata<i> |CITS:[15494399]| with a 98.7% similarity |CITS:[15878763]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the formation of both p-coumaroyl/caffeoyl shikimate and quinate esters, i.e. 
/hydroxycinnamoyl-Coenzyme A shikimate/quinate hydroxylcinnamoyl-transferase (HCT) was partially 
/purified from stems of tobacco and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. HCT also was able to 
/catalyze the reverse reaction (thioesterase reaction), i.e. the formation of caffeoyl-CoA and p-coumaroyl-CoA 
/from the corresponding hydroxycinnamoylesters indicating that the enzyme is involved both in upstream 
/and downstream reactions relative from the 3'-hydroxylation of those esters |CITS: [12381722]|.

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis AIM1 (AT4G29010) encodes one of the multifunctional proteins (MFPs). MFPs containing 2-trans-enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities are involved in fatty acid beta oxidation |CITS: [16507084]|. AIM1 mutants only accumulated residual level JA which suggests a critical role of AIM1 in JA synthesis.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonol 7-<i>O</i>-glucosyltransferase (AtGT-2) was isolated from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. 
/Its molecular function of attaching glucose to the 7-<i>O</i>-position of the A-ring was confirmed as recombinant 
/protein expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The enzyme preferred to glucosylate the 7-<i>O</i>-position of flavonols such 
/as kaempferol, quercetin and isorhamnetin, the flavanone naringenin or the flavones luteolin and apigenin and even
/the isoflavonoids genistein and daidzein. However, the enzyme also glucosylated the 3-<i>O</i>-position of the 
/flavonols with a about 20fold lower efficiency. As a minor product flavonol 3,5-diglucosides (kaempferol, quercetin, isorhamnetin) 
/were identified <i>in vitro</i> indicating that the enzyme may also be able to 3-<i>O</i>-glucosylate 7-<i>O</i>-glucosylated 
/flavonol derivatives |CITS: [14697269]|. In contrary to the reported substrate specificity of this enzyme another author 
/reported the characterization of an enzyme encoded by the same locus (At4g34135) that has been specific for the 
/3-<i>O</i>-position (C-ring) of flavonols, flavanones and flavones but also had a lower affinity to glucosylate the 
/7-<i>O</i>-position (A-ring) of kaempferol and quercetin |CITS: [Kim06]|. The reversed position preference of the 
/two reported enzymes originating from the same locus remains to be validated. 
/Additional information: The Arabidopsis locus At4g34135 consists of two splice variants (At4g34135.1 and At4g34135.2)

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis AIM1 (AT4G29010) encodes one of the multifunctional proteins (MFPs). MFPs containing 2-trans-enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities are involved in fatty acid beta oxidation |CITS: [16507084]|. AIM1 mutants only accumulated residual level JA which suggests a critical role of AIM1 in JA synthesis.

COMMENT - A 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde synthase (HBS) activity was detected in cell-free root extracts of carrot. The enzyme activity did not require any cofactors and was found to be increased by DTT. In addition, HBS activity was almost 5-fold higher in methyl jasmonate-treated roots than the control roots. 
/
/The non-oxidative cleavage of 4-coumarate to yield 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde probably involves multiple steps and requires a hydrolase activity following the hydration reaction |CITS: [17658659]|. However no intermediates were detected in the in vitro assay of this unpurified carrot enzyme. It remains unclear whether the conversion of 4-coumarate to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde involves multiple steps and multiple enzymes.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonol 3-<i>O</i>-glucosyltransferase (AtGT-1) was isolated from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. 
/Its molecular function of attaching glucose to the 3-<i>O</i>-position of the C-ring was confirmed as recombinant 
/protein expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. However, although the enzyme preferred to glucosylate the 3-<i>O</i>-position 
/of flavonols such as kaempferol, quercetin and isorhamnetin, flavonoids missing the 3-hydroxyl group such as the 
/flavanones eriodictyol and naringenin or the flavones luteolin and apigenin were glucosylated with high efficiency 
/at the 7-<i>O</i>-position of the A-ring |CITS: [KIM06]|. In contrary to the reported substrate specificity of this 
/enzyme another author reported the characterization of an enzyme encoded by the same locus (At4g34135) that 
/has been specific for the 7-<i>O</i>-position (A-ring) of flavonols, flavanones and flavones but also had a lower 
/affinity to glucosylate the 3-<i>O</i>-position (C-ring) of kaempferol and quercetin, eventually also forming the 
/flavonol 3,5-diglucosides |CITS: [14697269]|. The reversed position preference of the two reported enzymes 
/originating from the same locus remains to be validated but may reflect the low substrate specificity of that 
/glucosyltransferase (UGT73B2). 
/Additional information: The Arabidopsis locus At4g34135 consists of two splice variants (At4g34135.1 and At4g34135.2)

/of NADH. However MDHAR isolated from pea can effectively use NADPH as an alternative electron donor where the 
/Km for NADPH is only 4 times higher than that of NADH. 
/The enzyme is specific in reducing ascorbate or ferricyanide. Glutathione, cytochrome c, dehydroascorbate, 
/methylene blue and ferredoxin cannot be reduced by the enzyme. 
/Dicumarol inhibits enzyme activity. The Ki is 74.3 uM.

COMMENT - Flavanone-3&beta;-hydroxylase catalyzing the Fe(II)/oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylation of (2S)/(-)-flavanones to 
/(2R, 3R)/(+)-dihydroflavanols (flavanonols) has been purified from <i>Petunia x hybrida</i> |CITS: [2154946]|. The 
/cDNA encoding the enzyme was isolated from petunia petals and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> confirming 
/the molecular function and essential cofactors needed for the enzymatic reaction (ferreous ions, 2-oxoglutarate, ascorbate, 
/molecular oxygen) |CITS: [1544919]|. The enzyme readily undergoes proteolysis in crude extracts and on expression 
/in <i>E. coli</i> which hampers the exact determination of enzyme properties. It had been found that the responsible 
/protease most likely cleaves the Glu 337-Leu 338 bond resulting in the loss of a small carboxy-terminal portion which 
/seems to be essential for the enzyme activity |CITS: [10700394]|. This finding was corroborated by using C-terminally 
/truncated enzyme forms which indeed were accompanied by the gradual loss of enzyme activity but without influence 
/on the substrate specificity. The petunia flavanone-3&beta;-hydroxylase preferred naringenin as a substrate to form 
/dihydrokaempferol but the conversion of pinocembrin to pinobanksin or eriodictyol to taxifolin was also exhibited with 
/high efficiency |CITS: [15013767]|.

COMMENT - An Arabidopsis cDNA coding for methionine synthase (MS) was isolated using primers deduced from the MS 
/sequences of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> and <i>Catharanthus blumei</i>. The enzyme was cytosolic as confirmed 
/by polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> methionine synthase. This 
/result was discussed as a result of cellular compartimentation for methionine biosynthesis, with the chloroplast 
/catalyzing the conversion from cysteine to homocysteine and the cytosol producing methionine from homocysteine. 
/Souther blot analysis suggested the existence of one gene copy for MS in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [GAKIERE99]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonol 3-<i>O</i>-glucosyltransferase (AtGT-1) was isolated from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. 
/Its molecular function of attaching glucose to the 3-<i>O</i>-position of the C-ring was confirmed as recombinant 
/protein expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. However, although the enzyme preferred to glucosylate the 3-<i>O</i>-position 
/of flavonols such as kaempferol, quercetin and isorhamnetin, flavonoids missing the 3-hydroxyl group such as the 
/flavanones eriodictyol and naringenin or the flavones luteolin and apigenin were glucosylated with high efficiency 
/at the 7-<i>O</i>-position of the A-ring |CITS: [KIM06]|. In contrary to the reported substrate specificity of this 
/enzyme another author reported the characterization of an enzyme encoded by the same locus (At4g34135) that 
/has been specific for the 7-<i>O</i>-position (A-ring) of flavonols, flavanones and flavones but also had a lower 
/affinity to glucosylate the 3-<i>O</i>-position (C-ring) of kaempferol and quercetin, eventually also forming the 
/flavonol 3,5-diglucosides |CITS: [14697269]|. The reversed position preference of the two reported enzymes 
/originating from the same locus remains to be validated but may reflect the low substrate specificity of that 
/glucosyltransferase (UGT73B2). 
/Additional information: The Arabidopsis locus At4g34135 consists of two splice variants (At4g34135.1 and At4g34135.2)

BASIS-FOR-ASSIGNMENT - :MANUAL
CITATIONS - 19561332:EV-EXP-IDA-PURIFIED-PROTEIN-HH:3559303011:hartmut
COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was identified from a cDNA library of |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| induced <i>Catharanthus roseua</i> cultured cells. The cDNA was expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized with regard to molecular function and catalytic properties. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UGT3) was able to catalyze the sequential sugar chain elongation of |FRAME:CPD-6622 curcumin monoglucoside| to yield, over time, |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside|, curcumin gentiotrioside and curcumin gentiotetroside. 
/
/UGT3 only exhibited activity with |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| and catalyzed the 1,6-addition of |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| to another |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| molecule, hence forming gentiosides of varying length. The enzyme did not exhibit activity on the |FRAME:CPD-6602 curcumin| aglycone. The Km values of the monoglucoside |FRAME:CPD-6622 curcumin monoglucoside| and the gentiobioside |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside| were similar  and the Kcat/Km for |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside| was 3 times lower than for |FRAME:CPD-6622 curcumin monoglucoside|. In contrast to that the Km value of quercetin gentiobioside was 5times higher and the enzymatic efficiency (Kcat/Km) was 72times lower compared to |FRAME:CPD1F-437 quercetin-3-glucoside| indicating a better catalytic activity for of UGT3 for |FRAME:CPD-6624 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobioside| than for its |FRAME:CPD-520 quercetin| counterpart in the quercetin 3-<i>O</i>-gentiotetroside biosynthesis. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase also 1,6-glucosylated |FRAME:CPD-6623 curcumin diglucoside| forming |FRAME:CPD-6625 curcumin 4'-O-&beta;-D-gentiobiosyl 4''-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| in the process.
/
/The strict restriction to |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| as sugar donor for UGT3 and the discrepancy in amino acid sequences indicates that UGT3 and the earlier characterized |MONOMER-10641| |CITS:[15178322]| are not identical. UGT3 transcripts were only detected in leaves of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>.  The <i>in vivo</i> function of UGT3 as curcumin glucosyltransferase remains to be shown as curcumin and its gentiosides have not yet been reported from <i>Catharanthus</i> indicating another or additional function of the glucosyltransferase in e.g. xenobitics detoxification |CITS:[19561332]|.

COMMENT - DNA encoding methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM3) has been identified and partially characterized 
/in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. MAM3, also known as MAM-L catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with 
/a series of &omega;-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic acids which are involved in the biosynthesis of the C3 to C8 
/aliphatic glucosinolates know to occur in Arabidopsis. This molecular function was confirmed by recombinant 
/expression and characterization of the enzyme in <i>E. coli</i> and complementation of MAM3 deficient mutants 
/of Arabidopsis that lack the range of long chain C6 to C8 glucosinolates. The enzyme in general expressed 
/broad substrate specificity towards substrates such as pyruvate and 2-oxoisovalerate converting them to 
/citramalate and 2-isopropylmalate, respectively. However, it has been demonstrated that this does not represent 
/an <i>in vivo</i> activity of the enzyme. MAM3 has been shown to be localized in chloroplasts |CITS: [17369439]|.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase is considered to catalyze the first step in the retrieval 
/of isoflavone aglycons from the conjugate cycle. However, the liberation of malonic acid has not been reported in 
/<i>Spinacea oleracea</i> and <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> indicating that the malonylation of 7-O-glucosides may not 
/be mandatory for all plants |CITS: [4643301]|. The malonylesterase in chickpea is associated with the vacuolar 
/membrane |CITS: [Mackenbrock92]|, which may be the reason for the observed interference with the malonyltransferase 
/activity in crude extracts |CITS: [6497385]|.
/
/Nevertheless, the high specificity of the enzyme for isoflavone malonylglucoside (e.g. biochanin A-7-O-glucoside-6"-O-malonate) 
/adds to the body of evidence for an existing interconversion isoflavone conjugate cycle.  
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase isolated from chickpea acts specifically with isoflavone 
/malonylglucosides and is different from unspecific (synthetic) acylhydrolases being active with naphtyl or phenyl esters. 
/
/Ultrafiltration indicated a unusual high molecular weight around 300 kD, however it has been shown that the enzyme 
/aggregates with membrane material. SDS gel electrophoresis resulted in a single subunit of 32 kD |CITS: [3740841]|.
/It has been demonstrated, that the enzyme <i>in vivo</i> binds to membrane structures which may be necessary to 
/achieve full enzyme activity. 
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase is different from other plant esterases being insensitive 
/to most of the usual esterase inhibitors. However, Hg2+ and p-hydroxmercuribenzoate did efficiently inhibit the reaction, 
/suggesting that essential SH groups are required |CITS: [3740841]|.

COMMENT - A |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| dependent curcumin glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UCGGT) was identified, purified and catalytically characterized from |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| treated cultured cells of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>. The UCGGT transferred |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| with strict regioselectivity (1->6) to various flavonoid glucosides, hence biosynthesizing the respective gentioside derivatives. 
/
/UCGGT catalyzed the corresponding gentiobioside formation of the flavonol glucosides |FRAME:CPD1F-437 quercetin-3-glucoside|, |FRAME:CPD1F-453 kaempferol-3-glucoside| and |FRAME:CPD-14843 myricetin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside| and the flavone glucoside |FRAME: LUTEOLIN-7-O-BETA-D-GLUCOSIDE luteolin 7-<i>O</i>-glucoside|. The preferred activated sugar donor for the curcumin glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&alpha;-D-glucose| but the enzyme also exhibited a relative activity of 26% towards |FRAME:CPD-14553 UDP-&alpha;-D-galactose| |CITS:[17940060]|.

COMMENT - Heterologous expression in yeast cells demonstrated that CYP703A2 preferentially catalyzed the conversion of laurate to in-chain hydroxylaurates. Carbon atom 7 was the major site of hydroxylation. The in vitro enzyme activity towards palmitate was poor compared to laurate. Stearate, unsaturated long-chain fatty acids and phenylpropanoids were not metabolized by CYP703A2 |CITS: [17496121]|.
/
/CYP703A2 is specifically expressed in developing anthers. Mutant plants showed impaired pollen wall with absence of exine.

COMMENT - Purified recombinant UGT71G1 catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to at least two
/different triterpene saponin aglycones in Medicago truncatula, namely medicagenate (medicagenic acid)
/and hederagenin |CITS: [15743451]|. Though single products are formed in these reactions,
/the exact location of the glucosylation remains ambiguous. Both hederagenin and medicagenate may
/be glucosylated on their C-3, C-23, and/or C-28 hydroxyl groups by this enzyme. Docking analysis
/performed using a crystal structure for this enzyme suggests that the C-3 hydroxyl group should be the
/favored substrate for UGT71G1 on these two sapogenins |CITS: [16214900]|. However, the
/medicagenate-monoglucoside products generated by in vitro reactions using purified recombinant
/UGT71G1 did not co-chromatograph with an authentic sample of medicagenate-3-glucoside
/|CITS: [15743451]|. 
/
/UGT71G1 does not appear to glycosylate three other prevalent triterpene sapogenins, soyasapogenols
/B and E, and bayogenin in vitro, nor does it catalyze reactions using UDP-galactose or UDP-glucuronic
/acid. However, it does show high levels of activity with several other phenolic substrates. Notably,
/UGT71G1 has a lower Km (<50 uM) and a higher Kcat (> 0.12 /sec) with |FRAME: CPD-520 quercetin|,
/|FRAME: CPD-3141 genistein|, and |FRAME:BIOCHANIN-A biochanin-A| than with hederagenin
/(Km = 166 uM, Kcat = 0.025 /sec). Mutational analysis has been
/used to identify residues in UGT71G1 that influence its regioselectivity for |FRAME: CPD-520 quercetin| and
/|FRAME: CPD-3141 genistein| |CITS: [16982612]|. Though this information could be used to help to design enzymes capable
/of generating desirable glycosylated phenolics |CITS: [16982612]|, combined transcript and
/metabolite analyses suggest that hederagenin and medicagenate are the biologically relevant
/substrates of UGT71G1 |CITS: [15743451]|. For instance, methyl jasmonate treatment of dark-grown cell suspension
/cultures up-regulates UGT71G1 transcript levels. Triterpene saponin glycosides also accumulate under
/these conditions, whereas flavonoid / isoflavonoid glycoside levels do not rise. On the other hand, the
/levels of these (iso)flavonoid compounds, such as genistein-7-O-glucoside, rise following treatment
/with yeast elicitor even though UGT71G1 transcript levels do not increase.
/In addition, there is no evidence of quercetin glycosides present either in uninduced or
/yeast-elicitor-induced cultures,  suggesting that the best in vitro substrate does not get glycosylated
/by UGT71G1 in these M. truncatula cell lines |CITS: [15743451]|. 
/
/UGT71G1 transcripts can be detected by RT-PCR in roots, leaves, peticles, stems, and at somewhat
/higher levels in flowers |CITS: [15743451]|. Due to its presumed role in plant defense, elevated
/levels of UGT71G1 transcripts can be detected 24 hours after methyl jasmonate induction. The levels
/of this transcript increase later than the levels of transcripts for UGT73K1 another
/UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) active on triterpene sapogenins, and |FRAME: MONOMER-12196 &beta;-amyrin synthase|,
/an important upstream enzyme required for the formation of the sapogenin substrates of UGT71G1.
/Interestingly, the expected products of UGT71G1 also appear later than those of
/UGT73K1 |CITS: [15743451]|. 
/
/UGT71G1 appears to be a member of a subfamily of UDP-glycosyltransferases that includes the
/UGT71D2 protein from Arabidopsis |CITS: [11042215], [15743451]|. These and other closely related
/proteins from cassava (Manihot esculenta) and Solanum tuberosum |CITS: [15743451]|
/belong to the larger <A href="http://www.cazy.org/fam/GT1.html">Glycosyltransferase Family1</A>.

COMMENT - Plant glucosyltransferases are recognized to possess a pronounced capability to glucosylate a broad range of various 
/compounds, ranging from phenols, aromatic acids, coumarins, cyanogenic glucosides, glucosinolates  to flavonoids, 
/anthocyanins and monolignols. 
/
/The glucosylation of selected isoflavones is the first committed reaction towards the interconversion cycle of isoflavone 
/conjugates. The remarkable high specificity of the purified glucosyltransferase for isoflavones and pterocarpans 
/underlines the involvement of those conjugates in the flexible production of defense compounds in legumes |CITS: [6458246]|.
/Trifolirhizin (maackiain-3-O-glucoside) is found in relatively high concentrations in red clover but vanishes almost 
/completely after infection to release maackiain as a defense compound |CITS: [McMurchy84]|.
/
/The monomeric UDPG: isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase isolated from <i>Cicer arietinum</i> expressed a specifically 
/high catalytic potential to glucosylate the 7-O-position of isoflavones bearing a hydroxyl or methoxyl group at the 
/para - position of the B-ring. 
/
/The 4'-O-methylated isoflavones (biochanin A, formononetin) are the preferred substrates followed by the 
/4'-O-hydroxylated isoflavones (daidzein, genistein) with compareable lower turnover rates |CITS: [6458246]|.
/
/The glucosylation of hydroxyl substitutes isoflavones, flavones, flavanones, flavanols, coumarins, cinnamic acids, 
/and benzoic acids could not be catalyzed at all. Biochanin A and formononetin are the main constitutive phenolic 
/compounds in chick pea roots indicating that the isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase may have been adapted in 
/legumes in both a tissue and substrate specific manner.

COMMENT - The enzyme is specific for O-acetyl-L-serine as the alanyl donor. Other esters of L-serine, such as phosphate and sulfate, or L-serine itself could not serve as the alanyl donor|CITS: [murakoshi78]|. 
/The rate of willardiine and isowillardiine reached the maximum with a final concentration of uracil of 1 mM. Higher concentration of uracil (>10 mM) is inhibitory. Pyridoxal 5-phosphate is a required cofactor. Higher concentration (> 0.1 mM) is however inhibitory. The enzyme is feed-back inhibited by its end products. At 30 mM, both willardiine and isowillardiine caused 75-95% inhibition|CITS: [ahmmad84]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the prenylation of 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan (DHP) to form phaseollidin has been examined in 
/microsomal fractions of <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>. DHP is an intermediate in the biosynthetic sequence towards 
/glyceollins, hence representing a branching point for prenylation in different legumes |CITS: [Biggs87]|. 
/
/The prenyltransferase (dimethylallylpyrophosphate:3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 10-dimethylallyl transferase) is specific 
/for the 10 position of DHP (D-ring), whereas the prenyltransferases involved in glyceollin biosynthesis specifically 
/catalyze the prenylation of 3,6a,9-trihydroxypterocarpan (THP, glycinol) at the 2 or 4 position in the A-ring |CITS: [Zaehringer81]|.
/Although provided with a racemic mixture of (+/-)-DHP only the (-)-enantiomer of the substrate had been accepted 
/by the prenyltransferase producing the corresponding (-)-phaseollidin |CITS: [Biggs87]|.
/
/The intracellular location of prenyltransferases involved in both glyceollin (soybean) and phaseollin (bean) biosynthesis 
/has been pinpointed to the chloroplast inner envelope membrane using sucrose- and Percoll-gradient centrifugation.
/In conclusion a movement of isoflavonoid intermediates between cell membranes was proposed, where the di- and 
/trihydroxylated pterocarpans (DHP, THP) are transferred to the plastids for prenylation and returned to the endoplasmatic 
/reticulum for subsequent cyclization |CITS: [Biggs90]|.
/
/The prenyltransferase showed maximal activity over a broader pH range of 7-8. Especially interesting is the finding that the 
/bean prenyltransferase is competitively inhibited by immediate and subsequent products (phaseollidin, phaseollin) 
/whereas such an inhibition was not reported for the soybean prenyltransferase |CITS: [Biggs87]|. Prenyltransferase activities 
/are significantly increased upon elicitation and have not been found in unchallenged plants.

COMMENT - The full length cDNA of the sinapoylglucose: choline sinapoyltransferase from <i>Brassica napus</i> (BnSCT) was isolated 
/by screening the cDNA library of immature seeds using a serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) protein specific probe
/|CITS: [15053762]|. It has been shown that those acetyltransferases accepting sinapoylglucose as donor are homolog 
/to hydrolases of the serine carboxypetptidase type, however they do not function as such. It has been proposed that the 
/acyltransferases may have been developed as a result of divergent evolution |CITS: [15003414]| co-opting this new 
/enzyme activity.
/
/It has been suggested that the SCT of <i>Brassica napus</i>, similar to the sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase 
/(SMT) in Arabidopsis |CITS: [12012238]|, is synthesized as a precursor targeted to the endoplasmatic reticulum, glucosylated 
/in the Golgi apparatus and transported to the vacuole where the catalytic activity has been observed |CITS: [15053762]|. 
/
/Genomic analyses revealed the presence of two SCT genes in <i>Brassica napus</i>, most probably the reflection that 
/those genes derived from the progenitor genoms of <i>Brassica oleracea</i> and <i>Brassica rapa</i>. The transcriptional 
/expression of BnSCT was strictly restricted to seed development which is in accordance with the expression pattern 
/of the other genes encoding for the remaining enzymes and their timed involvement in the sinapate ester biosynthetic 
/pathway |CITS: [15053762]|.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase shows a strong preference for isoflavones being 
/glucosylated at the 7-O-position of the A-ring. 
/
/Best substrates are the 4'-methoxylated compounds biochanin A-7-O-glucoside and formononetin-7-O-glucoside 
/followed by the 7-O-glucosides of the 4'-hydroxylated isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Various 7-O-glucosylated 
/flavones and flavonols could also be converted, however with a greatly decreased affinity for the malonyltransferase. 
/The 4'-O-glucosylated isoflavones could not act as acceptors, indicating that the 7-O-glucosylation is a precondition 
/for isoflavone specific malonyltransferase activity. 
/
/The  isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase had a molecular weight of 112 kD. However, other 
/purified plant malonyltransferases acting on flavone/flavonol-7-O-glucosides or flavonol-3-O-glucosides possess 
/molecular weights of around 50 kD |CITS: [6639051]|. Therefore, a possible dimeric composition of the chick pea 
/enzyme has not yet been excluded.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) has been identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Its molecular function of catalyzing the hydrolysis of L-arginine to form urea and L-ornithine has bee confirmed by functional complementation of an arginase-deficient yeast mutant. It has been suggested that the enzyme is involved in the mobilization of storage protein nitrogen |CITS:[7770544]|. The relationship of this urea cycle enzyme with the urea degradation has been demonstrated by the inhibition of urease which resulted in the accumulation of urea due to the metabolic activity of arginase |CITS:[7770520]|.

COMMENT - This hypothetical activity is proposed by Ephritikhine |CITS: [10377996]|. However, a later paper that focuses on characterizing the biochemical activity of this enzyme suggests that the abundance of this substrate is likely quite low in Arabidopsis. Therefore, the authors propose that this enzyme works primarily on campesterol and campestanol |CITS: [16460510]|.

Recombinant CiOMT1 showed both 7'- and 6'-O-methylation activities at the last two steps of emetine biosynthesis |CITS: [21228475]|. 7'-O-demethylcephaeline was the preferred substrate. The enzyme activity with cephaeline was very low.

COMMENT - 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is a therapeutic furanocoumarin, or psoralen, that is primarily found in plants belonging to the Apiaceae and Rutaceae families. 8-MOP has not been reported in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis P450s CYP82C2 and CYP82C4 were shown to be able to convert 8-MOP to 5-hydroxy 8-MOP.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding the anthocyanin 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) in <i>Vitis vinifera</i> attaching a 
/glucose moiety to the 3-position of the C-ring was isolated and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. 
/The purified, recombinant enzyme expressed a high affinity towards flavonol and anthocyanidin substrates. 
/However, a comparison of the UFGT acitivity obtained from two <i>Vitis vinifera</i> varieties, one with 
/white berries and the other one having red berries demonstrated that the enzyme is not responsible for the 
/glucosylation of flavonols <i>in planta</i> despite its ability to do so <i>in vitro</i>. Hence, the true natural 
/substrates for the UFGT are anthocyanidins produced in the red grapes. The glucosylation reaction was strongly 
/inhibited by Cu <sup>2+</sup> but it has been found that Cu<sup>2+</sup> acts rather on the anthocyanidin 
/substrates (bleaching, structure change) than on the enzyme itself |CITS: [9535914]|.

COMMENT - Nonleguminous plants isomerize only 6'-hydroxychalcone to 5-hydroxyflavanone (referred to as Typ I) whereas 
/leguminous plants convert both 6'-deoxychalcone and 6'-hydroxychalcone to 5-deoxyflavanone and 5-hydroxyflavanone 
/(referred to as Typ II). 
/
/In <i>Lotus japonicus</i> three isoenzymes (plus a putative fourth isoenzyme) have been identified to carry out the 
/cyclization of the 6'hydroxy- and 6'deoxychalcones towards flavanones and isoflavones, representing enzymatic 
/activities of both types.
/
/Vmax (nkat x mg-1) for LjCHI3 was 1.400 (naringenin chalcone) and 1.500 (isoliquiritigenin), respectively. 
/The apparent Km for naringenine chalcone was 5 uM  and for isoliquiritigenin 8 uM, with an pH optima of 8.0 to 8.5.

COMMENT - Acyl exchange between acyl-CoA and position 2 of sn-phosphatidylcholine (PC) was detected in microsomal preparations of developing safflower cotyledons |CITS: [6497849]|. From the reverse reaction, PC-derived acyl-CoAs, which are rich in PUFA, can feed into the Kennedy pathway for DAG and TAG synthesis. Lysophosphatidylcholines produced in the reverse reaction can be converted back to PC to replenish the PC pool by the forward reaction. In addition, in the forward reaction de novo synthesized acyl-CoAs can be incorporated into PC. 
/
/The rate of the reverse reaction was 3-5% of the forward reaction |CITS: [6497849]|.

COMMENT - Cell-free extracts of <i>Citrus aurantium</i> have been shown to convert naringenin-7-O-glucoside (prunin) to 
/narirutin, i.e. naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. The L-rhamnose is transferred to the C-6 position of the glucose moiety 
/(1-6 binding) typical for the tasteless (non-bitter) compounds found in those members of the <i>Citrus</i> genus. 
/The enzymatic activity is extended towards hesperitin-7-O-glucoside forming the corresponding 6"-O-rhamnoside 
/neohesperidin. The enzymatic assay was carried out using an combined approach which included the exogenous 
/addition of UDP-glucose and NADPH to the crude extract allowing to form L-rhamnose (|FRAME:PWY-3261|). 
/Although the formation of the flavanone 7-O-glucoside-6"-O-rhamnoside(s) have been demonstrated the

COMMENT - The GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCHI) from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> was identified by using the protein sequence of the 
/<i>E. coli</i> and mammalian GCHI. The functionality of the enzyme was proven by complementing a yeast <i>fol2</i> 
/mutant and by demonstrating the enzyme activity in extracts of comlemented yeast. The GCHI cDNA was shown to 
/encode a unique bimodular enzyme. The GCHI is a dimer with subunits of about 50 kDa and consists of two GCHI-like 
/domains in tandem. Both domains are necessary to present the functional protein. The transit sequence in GCHI indicates 
/a cytosolic location of the enzyme |CITS: [12221287]|.

COMMENT - The bifunctional dihydrofolat reductase (DHFR)/thymidylate synthase (TS) was purified to apparent homogeneity 
/from pea mitochondria, which appears to be the major subcellular location for this enzyme. The TS catalyzed 
/reaction produces dihydrofolate the immediate substrate for the DHFR. The polypeptide consists of two domains, 
/one harboring the DHFR activity and the other one containing the TS activity. The spatial distinction has been 
/proved using DHFR and TS specific inhibitors which did not affect the complementary enzyme activity. The DHFR 
/expressed almost the same activity for both mono- and pentaglutamylated substrates. In contrast, TS affinity 
/improved significantly with the increasing number of glutamate residues attached to the substrate |CITS: [8621617]|.

COMMENT - The malonylation of isoflavone glucosides has been suggested to be prerequisite for efficient passage of those compounds 
/through the tonoplast. Malonylation renders the isoflavone glucosides more water soluble, consequently more suitable 
/for vacuole storage. The malonylation step has been discussed as final step of the isoflavone conjugates biosynthesis 
/|CITS: [6639051]|.
/
/However, the isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase activity had been found strongly inhibited by
/distinct isoflavone-specific malonylesterase and glucohydrolase activities in crude extracts of <i>Cicer arietinum</i>,
/which rather points at the existence of an isoflavone conjugate cycle with a subcellular compartmentation of the enzyme
/|CITS: [6497385]|.
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase shows a strong preference for isoflavones being 
/glucosylated at the 7-O-position of the A-ring. Best substrates are the 4'-methoxylated compounds 
/biochanin A-7-O-glucoside and formononetin-7-O-glucoside followed by the 7-O-glucosides of the 4'-hydroxylated 
/isoflavones daidzein and genistein. 
/
/Various 7-O-glucosylated flavones and flavonols could also be converted, however with a greatly decreased affinity 
/for the malonyltransferase. The 4'-O-glucosylated isoflavones could not act as acceptors, indicating that the 
/7-O-glucosylation is a precondition for isoflavone specific malonyltransferase activity |CITS: [6497385]|.
/
/The  isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase had a molecular weight of 112 kD. However, 
/other purified plant malonyltransferases acting on flavone/flavonol-7-O-glucosides or flavonol-3-O-glucosides 
/possess molecular weights of around 50 kD |CITS: [6639051]|. Therefore, a possible dimeric composition of the 
/chick pea enzyme has not yet been excluded.

COMMENT - A cDNA from soybean encoding an aminoalcoholphosphotransferase (AAPT) which catalyses the formation of 
/phosphatidylcholine from CDP-choline was isolated by complementation of a double mutant yeast lacking CDP-choline 
/phosphotransferase activity. The expressed protein as obtained from yeast microsomes showed strong CDP-choline 
/phosphotransferase activity and was competitively inhibited by both CDP-ethanolamine and CDP-choline providing 
/evidence that the enzyme <i>in vivo</i> may process both CDP-aminoalcohols. Based on the hydropathy profile 
/soybean AAPT is a membrane-bounded or associated enzyme. Its predicted amino acid sequence shows homology 
/similar to the two aminoalcoholphosphotransferases present in yeast. Experiments with AAPT1 cDNA's slightly differing 
/only in length (5'flanking region) showed a considerably decrease in cholinephosphorase activity pointing to a possible 
/post-transcriptional regulation of this protein |CITS: [7994181]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a UDPG:glucosyltransferase in a <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> cell suspension culture 
/(CaUGT2) was isolated from a corresponding cDNA library using a PCR approach at the conserved UDP-binding 
/domain (PSPG-box) of plant glucosyltransferases. The CaUGT2 was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> 
/and its kinetic properties characterized. The CaUGT2 was able to catalyze the glucosylation of curcumin and 
/its monoglucoside in a sequential manner. The UDPG:glucosyltransferase had a broader substrate specificity 
/comparable to other plant glucosyltransferase but converted curcumin and curcumin monoglucoside with high 
/efficiency. However, the enzyme did not glucosylate gingerol and capsaicin, although structurally close to curcumin, 
/and did also not produce the diglucoside from esculetin. Although the enzyme was also able to use UDP-galactose 
/its preferred co-substrate was clearly UDP-glucose with a Km 4-fold lower than that of UDP-glactose. The 
/optimal pH of the enzyme was between 7.5 and 8. The expression of CaUGT2 was induced by methyl jasmonate 
/and salicylic acid indicating its possible involvement in defense mechanisms of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>

COMMENT - The isoflavone 2'-hydroxylase cloned from licorice (Glycyrrhiza echinata) catalyzes the hydroxylation of isoflavones, 
/daidzein and formononetin, and to a lower extend genistein, yielding the corresponding 2'-hydroxylated products 
/|CITS: [9790908]|.
/
/The corresponding enzymes in chickpea and alfalfa prefer the 4-methoxyisoflavones over the 4'-hydroxy analogues 
/|CITS: [Hinderer87]|. However, it is well established that the glyceollins derive from the 4'-hydroxy isoflavone daidzein, 
/hence daidzein and their subsequent unmethoxylated intermediates must be suitable substrates for the enzymes 
/involved in this pathway. 
/
/It has been demonstrated for the first time that the Cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase (CYP81E1) constitutes 
/the isoflavone-2'-hydroxylase  |CITS: [9790908]| involved in the biosynthesis of isoflavonoid-derived phytoalexins, such 
/as maackiain |CITS: [Dewick78]|, pisatin |CITS: [Banks82]|, medicarpin |CITS: [Daniel90]| and glyceollin |CITS: [Heller94]|.
/
/The reaction rates with licorice CYP81E1 protein expressed in yeast were 340 nkat/kg protein or higher for formononetin, 
/ca. 40 nkat/kg protein for daidzein and ca. 9 nkat/kg protein for genistein |CITS: [9790908]|.

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis ecotype Col does not contain 2-hydroxy-3-butenylglucosinolate due to the lack of its precursor 3-butenylglucosinolate. But Col has a functional 3-butenylglucosinolate 2-hydroxylase. After introducing a functional AOP2 (for generating in vivo the precursor 3-butenylglucosinolate), both 3-butenylglucosinolate and 2-hydroxy-3-butenylglucosinolate were accumulated.

COMMENT - The recombinant Arabidopsis acyl-CoA thioesterase (encoded by ACH2) hydrolyzes both medium and 
/long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. It has highest activity towards long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Maximum rates 
/were found with palmitoleoyl-CoA. The enzyme is insensitive to feedback inhibition by free coenzyme A. 
/The ACH2 gene is highly expressed in mature tissues rather than in germinating seedlings where fatty 
/acid beta-oxidation predominantly occurs. It indicates the role of the Arabidopsis ACH2, unlike what was 
/suggested for the animal and yeast homologs, is not linked to fatty acid oxidation.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was identified from a cDNA library of |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| induced <i>Catharanthus roseua</i> cultured cells. The cDNA was expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized with regard to molecular function and catalytic properties. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UGT3) was able to catalyze the 1,6-glucosylation of |FRAME:CPD-3421 genistin| to yield  |FRAME:CPD-14848 genistin 7-gentiobioside|. 
/
/UGT3 only exhibited activity with |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| and catalyzed the 1,6-addition of |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| to another |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| molecule, hence forming gentiosides of varying length. UGT3 transcripts were only detected in leaves of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>.  The <i>in vivo</i> function of UGT3 as genistin glucosyltransferase remains to be shown as genistin gentiosides have not yet been reported from <i>Catharanthus</i> indicating another or additional function of the glucosyltransferase in xenobitics detoxification |CITS:[19561332]|.

/The homodimeric PDSTS2 preferred cinnamoyl-CoA producing pinosylvin but accepted in contrast to the <i>P. sylvestris</i> 
/STS2 p-coumaryl-CoA as well (resveratrol production). Pinosylvin inhibits PDSTS2 in a noncompetitive manner but with

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding a pinocembrin chalcone forming pinocembrin chalcone synthase (PDCHSX) was isolated from seedlings 
/of <i>Pinus densiflora</i>. The homodimeric protein was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized. 
/The enzyme preferred cinnamoyl-CoA resulting in the production of pinocembrin chalcone over p-coumraoyl-CoA (formation 
/of naringenin chalcone). Pinosylvin as well as pinocembrin efficiently inhibits PDCHSX in a noncompetitive manner. Pinocembrin 
/also inhibits PDSTS2, i.e. a coexisting stilbene synthase catalyzing the formation of pinosylvin (|FRAME: PWY-5045|) |CITS: [11880657]|. 
/The observed reciprocative product inhibition of pinocembrin chalcone synthase and co-existing stilbene synthases was discussed 
/as an important factor to maintain the balance between stilbenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis |CITS: [11880657]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding flavone synthase II (CYP93B2) was isolated from <i>Gerbera hybrida</i> and its molecular function

/but only in lines with dominant wild-type alleles and not recessive alleles (fns fns). The enzyme is an cytochrome P450 
/dependent monooxygenase catalyzing the 2,3-desaturation of flavanones such as naringenin and eriodictyol to form 
/the corresponding flavones apigenin and luteolin, respectively |CITS: [10652133]|.

COMMENT - 13-DES activity has been detected from garlic bulb. The unpurified enzyme was shown to convert 13-HPOD and 13-HPOT to etheroleic acid and etherolenic acid, respectively. The enzyme activity towards 13-HPOD is higher than that of 13-HPOT. 9-HPOD was not an effective substrate.  The enzyme has a strong stereo preference for the (S)-enantiomer substrates. After incubation with 13(R,S)-HPOD, 94% remaining substrates are 13(R)-HPOD.

COMMENT - The phospholipase D (PLD) from castor bean was purified from 2 day postgerminated endosperm. Oligonuclotide probes 
/obtained from the N-terminal sequence were used to isolate a PLD cDNA, which was expressed and functionally 
/characterized in <i>E. coli</i>. It has been shown that the functional enzyme possesses a 30 amino acid leader peptide, 
/demonstrated to be essential for enzymatic activity and protein stability. The assumed role for this leader sequence 
/was, that it may be necessary for proper folding of the PLD and/or serve as a transit signal peptide to target the protein 
/into vacuoles or plastids. Immunolocalization of PLD in castor bean revealed its presence in vacuoles, endoplasmatic 
/reticulum, plastids and some plasmamembranes. The cloned PLD was shown to be fully functional, catalyzing both the 
/hydrolysis and transphosphatidylation reaction |CITS: [8051126]|.

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis genome has nine functional genes encoding acyl-CoA synthetase|CITS: [12177484]|. 
/Genetic and biochemical evidence have sorted physiological roles for some of them. LACS2 is required 
/for cutin biosynthesis. LACS2 was shown to activate the cutin monomer 16-hydroxypalmitate|CITS: [14973169]|. 
/The resulted 16-hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA is a substrate for the second hydroxylation to yield another cutin 
/monomer 10,16-dihydroxypalmitate. The LACS2 mutant shows defects in the cutin layer. The mutant 
/plants have reduced leaf size and plant growth, reduced seed production, and lower rates of seed 
/germination and seedling growth.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the glucosylation of coniferyl alcohol to form coniferin, i.e. UDPG:coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferase 
/(CAGT) was isolated from cambial sap of <i>Picea abies</i> and purified to homogeneity. The enzymatic reaction was 
/reversible with the forward reaction (coniferyl alcohol to coniferin) being six times faster than the reverse reaction (coniferin 
/to coniferyl alcohol). Product inhibition patterns are consistent with a mono-iso-ordered bibi mechanism involving two isomeric 
/enzyme forms |CITS: [6210530]|. Using immunofluorescent technique with an antiserum raised against CAGT the enzyme 
/was localized to the parietal cytoplasmatic layer of epidermal and subepidermal cells and cells in the vascular bundles 
/|CITS: [SCHMID82]|.

COMMENT - The enzymatic activity for transferring the glucosyl moiety of UDP-glucose to the carboxyl group of phenolic acids 
/has been described in extracts of <i>Raphanus sativus</i> seedlings. The highest specificity was expressed towards
/sinapic acid, but other phenolic acids (cinnamic acids, benzoic acids) were esterified as well with a rate of about 30 
/to 40% compared to sinapic acid. This result was explained with contamination of this extract containing a basic level 
/of unspecific transferase activities superimposed by a specific sinapate glucosyltransferase |CITS: [Strack80]|.

COMMENT - Activity in dark grown cells was observed upon induction by cell wall extracts of <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> 
/(formerly <i>Phytophthora megasperma</i> f.sp. <i>glycinea</i>) or <i>Alternaria carthami</i>, 
/and peaked 24 hours after induction.  
/Enzyme activity was characterized in the microsomal fraction of cell extracts.  Localization to the endoplasmic reticulum
/was determined by colocalization in a sucrose gradient of psoralen synthase activity with endoplasmic reticulum marker enzymes.

COMMENT - A flavanone 2'-hydroxylase activity was detected in the microsomal fraction of Sophora flavescens cell suspension culture |CITS: [11672730]|. It was tightly bound to the membranes. 
/
/The enzyme activity required NADPH and molecular oxygen, and was inhibited by CO or cytochrome C, which indicated that the enzyme is a cytochrome P450. NADPH could not be replaced by NADH (16% relative activity), FAD or FMN. 
/
/The enzyme had strict substrate specificity for flavanones. Only 8-dimethylallylnaringenin was hydroxylated. Kaempferol, quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringenin, 6-dimethylallylnaringenin, 3'- dimethylallylnaringenin were not hydroxylated.

COMMENT - This P450 dependent reaction catalyzes the hydroxylation of the calycosin B-ring 3'-methoxyl group and subsequent
/ring formation under water loss to yield the cyclic acetal. The methylenedioxy bridge catalyzing enzyme was first shown
/to be P450-dependent in the formation of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, such as (S)-stylopine |CITS: [Bauer91]|.
/
/The respective enzyme was preliminary named pseudobaptigenin synthase |CITS: [Clemens96]| or simply CYP(X) |CITS: [14617078]|,
/converting calycosin (3'-hydroxy-formononetin) to pseudobaptigenin. This methylenedioxy bridge enzyme also 
/converts pratensein (3'-hydroxy-biochanin A) to 5-hydroxy-pseudobaptigenin with similar efficiency, however beyond 
/it other substrates were not accepted |CITS: [Clemens96]|. This rather narrow substrate spectrum is in agreement with findings 
/in forming methylendioxy bridges in various alkaloids |CITS: [Bauer91]| |CITS: [Rueffer94]|.
/
/Pseudobaptigenin synthase adds to the enzymes in chickpea, which can easily be induced by elicitation. Non-induced 
/cells did not express noticeable activities of this enzyme |CITS: [Clemens96]|. This attribute again corresponds to the 
/P450 enzymes involved in the alkaloid biosynthetic route |CITS: [Bauer91]| |CITS: [Rueffer94]|.

COMMENT - Malonyl CoA: anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-6'''-O-malonyltransferase (SsMaT1) the enzyme that catalyzed the 
/regiospecific 6"'malonylation of bisdemalonylsalvianin and |FRAME:CPD-7714| with high efficiency was purified 
/from open flowers of <i>Salvia splendens</i>. In addition, the molecular function of the enzyme was confirmed by 
/recombinant expression of the isolated cDNA in <i>E. coli</i>. The enzyme did not malonylate monodemalonylsalvianin 
/indicating the presence of a second malonyltransferase in salvia nor was any intermediate of the pathway 
/without aromatic acyl groups (e.g. pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside) accepted. This and the fact that p-coumaric 
/acid and caffeic acid strongly inhibited the malonylation of bisdemalonylsalvianin indicate that aromatic acylation 
/precedes the aliphatic acylation towards the formation of salvianin. It appears that SsMaT1 has a cytosolic 
/location which contradicts the generally reported accumulation of anthocyanins in the vacuole |CITS: [11598135]|. 
/The reaction mechanism of this enzyme has been investigated in detail revealing the involvement of a ternary 
/complex that contains both substrates and the enzyme. In addition the importance of two amino acids, His167 
/and Asp390 for catalytic activity could be confirmed by investigating mutant enzymes |CITS: [12578391]|.

COMMENT - Three isomers of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) were isolated from <i>Anchusa officinalis</i> |CITS: [DEEKNAMKUL87]| 
/and named after their order of elution in anion-exchange TAT-1, TAT-2 and TAT-3 |CITS: [2889425]|. Tyrosine aminotransferases 
/represent the entrypoint enzyme of the tyrosine-derived pathway involved in rosmarinic acid biosynthesis and express, 
/in contrast to other plant aromatic aminotransferases, a relatively high specificity towards L-tyrosine. The observed high 
/pH optimum (TAT-1 - pH 9.0) also distinguishes those enzymes from other plant aromatic aminotransferases. The enzyme 
/catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate with &alpha;-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate being the 
/best co-substrates. TAT-1 has been purified to homogeneity and was shown to be a tetramer with subunits of 43 kDa

COMMENT - Purified recombinant UGT73K1 catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to at least three
/different triterpene saponin aglycones in Medicago truncatula, namely hederagenin, soyasapogenol B
/and soyasapogenol E |CITS: [15743451]|. Though single products are formed in these reactions,
/the exact location of the glucosylation remains ambiguous. For instance, soyasapogenol B may
/be glucosylated on its C-3, C-22, and/or C-23 hydroxyl group by this enzyme. UGT73K1 does not
/appear to glycosylate two other prevalent triterpene sapogenins, medicagenate (medicagenic acid)
/and bayogenin in vitro, nor does not it catalyze reactions using UDP-galactose or UDP-glucuronic acid.
/It also fails to interact with a number of different phenolic acceptors, such as catechin, |FRAME:CPD-3141 genistein|,
/|FRAME:DAIDZEIN daidzein|, |FRAME: CPD-520 quercetin|, |FRAME:CPD-3402 (-)-medicarpin|, and|FRAME:BIOCHANIN-A biochanin-A| |CITS: [15743451]|.  
/
/UGT73K1 transcripts can be detected by RT-PCR in flowers, leaves, peticles, stems, and at somewhat
/higher levels in roots. Levels of transcripts also rise in dark-grown cell suspension cultures about 8
/hours after treatment with methyl jasmonate and remain high for up to 48 hours.
/This matches the pattern of induction for |FRAME: MONOMER-12196 &beta;-amyrin synthase|, an important upstream
/enzyme required for the formation of the sapogenin substrates of UGT73K1 |CITS: [15743451]|. 
/
/UGT73K1 appears to be a member of a new subfamily of UDP-glycosyltransferases |CITS: [15743451]|
/within the larger <A href="http://www.cazy.org/fam/GT1.html">Glycosyltransferase Family1</A>.

COMMENT - The monomeric enzyme converting dihydroflavonols to the corresponding leucoanthocyanidins, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase 
/(DFR) has been isolated and purified to apparent homogeneity from flowers of <i>Dahlia variabilis</i>. The 
/enzyme reduced most efficiently dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin to their respective leucoanthocyanidins 
/leucopelargonidin and leucocyanidin. The conversion of dihydromyricetin to leucodelphinidin was also carried out 
/but at a slower rate. In addition, the conversion of (2S)-naringenin and (2S)-eriodictyol to the corresponding 
/flavan-4-ols apiforol and luteoforol was carried out |CITS: [3293532]|.

COMMENT - The k<sub>cat</sub> for |FRAME: CPD-12568 (3<i>S</i>,6<i>E</i>)-nerolidol| is 0.20 +/- 0.01 s<sup>-1</sup>, the k<sub>cat</sub> / K<sub>M</sub> is and 0.11 +/- 0.01 s<sup>-1</sup> &mu;M<sup>-1</sup>, and the V<sub>max</sub> is 29.09 +/- 1.39 pkcat/mg |CITS: [21088219]|.

/In different plant species, there is evidence for the formation of the (<i>R</i>)-, (<i>S</i>)- or both enantiomers of nerolidol and they may all participate in DMNT biosynthesis. CYP82G1 activity was only tested <i>in vitro</i> using |FRAME: CPD-12568 (3<i>S</i>,6<i>E</i>)-nerolidol|, but, molecular docking prediction studies do not indicate that binding of the (<i>R</i>) enantiomer would be significantly disfavored |CITS: [21088219]|.

COMMENT - Recombinant Arabidopsis PAO1 was expressed and purified from E. coli. The recombinant enzyme is a FAD-containing protein and had highest activity with norspermine, followed by spermine and N<sup>1</sup>-acetylspermine. The enzyme efficiency, Kcat/Km, was determined as 24.1 (S<sup>-1</sup> mM<sup>-1</sup>) for spermine, 81.4 for norspermine (4-fold higher than that for spermine), and 0.5 for N<sup>1</sup>-acetylspermine (50-fold lower than that for spermine). No activity was detected with substrate spermidine, putrescine, or N<sup>1</sup>-acetylspermidine.

COMMENT - Benzophenone synthase catalyzing the sequential condensation of three molecules of malonyl-CoA with one molecule 
/of m-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA to form the xanthone intermediate 2,3',4,6-tetrahydroxybenzophenone was isolated and 
/partially purified from cell-free extracts from cultured cells of <i>Centaurium erythraea</i>. 2,3',4,6-tetrahydroxybenzophenone 
/represents a central intermediate in xanthone biosynthesis which is furthermore converted in a regioselective manner 
/to different trihydroxyxanthones |CITS: [Peters98]|. Although accepting benzoyl-CoA as a substrate (44% relative specificity), 
/the enzyme exhibited the highest specificity towards m-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA |CITS:[8925910]|.

COMMENT - The identity of the gene was confirmed by heterologous expression in E. coli followed by enzyme assay. The in-vitro assay indicated that NAD+ is the preferred cofactor. No enzyme activity could be detected with either D-galactose, D-glucose, D-mannose or D-arabinose. Southern blot analysis indicated the Arabidopsis genome has a single copy of L-galactose dehydrogenase.

COMMENT - In addition to glutamate, aspartate was also accepted as amino donor |CITS: [21102469]|, with similar Km values. Among the keto acids, prephenate, oxaloacetate and 2-ketoglutarate served as substrates |CITS: [21102469]|.  
/
/In the presence of glutamate as amino donor, the recombinant Arabidopsis prephenate aminotransferase is nearly as efficient to transaminate prephenate or oxaloacetate |CITS: [20883697]|. The catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) for prephenate was 7 uM<sup>-1</sup>S<sup>-1</sup>, and was 8 uM<sup>-1</sup>S<sup>-1</sup> for oxaloacetate. It indicated that the enzyme can operate as a glutamate/aspartate-prephenate aminotransferase.

COMMENT - In Vaccaria hispanica, the triterpene carboxylic acid glucosyltransferase UGT74M1 may be involved in
/the production of a number of different monodesmoside saponins |CITS: [17172290]|.  The UGT74M1
/enzyme falls into the L cluster of
/<A href="http://www.cazy.org/fam/GT1.html">glucosyltransferase family 1</A> |CITS: [11042215]|.
/Several different triterpene aglycones, including gypsogenin, gypsogenate,
/16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate, and quillaic acid can all be glucosylated in vitro by recombinant
/purified UGT74M1. NMR analysis confirmed that the C-28 carboxyl carbon of gypsogenin is the
/site of glucosylation. But, given the low levels of gypsogenin-derived monodesmoside saponins,
/it is unclear if this reaction is biologically-relevant. Quillaic acid also does not appear to be
/glucosylated in V. hispanica. However, the saponin profile of V. hispanica suggests that
/gypsogenate and 16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate are likely substrates for this enzyme in vivo,
/and that they are glucosylated on the C28 carbon |CITS: [17172290]|. 
/
/In vitro, UGT74M1 shows the highest activity with 16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate, and lower
/levels of activity with gypsogenate (56%), gypsogenin (12%), and quillaic acid (11%). Although
/the enzyme has a lower apparent Km for the latter two compounds, it also has much higher apparent
/Kcat values for the two biologically relevant substrates, 16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate and
/gypsogenate . Notably, UGT74M1 shows similar Kcat values for these two compounds, but it
/has a lower apparent Km for gypsogenate, assumed to be the primary substrate
/in vivo |CITS: [17172290]|. UGT74M1 does not appear to use UDP-fucose or UDP-glucuronic acid
/as glycosyl donors in vitro, suggesting that it not does add these sugars during the first stages
/of bidesmoside saponin formation in V. hispanica. In addition, the enzyme seems to have a
/preference for a subset of oleanane saponin aglycones, but it also shows some weak in vitro
/activity towards a lupane triterpenoid, betulinic acid. Magnesium does not appear to be required for
/UGT74M1 activity in vitro |CITS: [17172290]|.
/
/UGT74M1 appears to be expressed in the leaves and roots of V. hispanica, but not in flowers, germinating seeds, or
/developing seeds |CITS:[17172290]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding aloesone synthase, a polyketide synthase typ III protein, was cloned and sequenced from roots 
/of <i>Rheum palmatum</i>. The enzyme was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified to apparent homogeneity 
/and characterized. The protein is a small homodimer (~90 kDa) catalyzing six successive decarboxylative polyketide 
/chain elongations followed by the regiospecific cyclization of the hepteketide intermediate resulting in the formation of 
/aloesone. The construction of this complex aromatic heptaketide by such a comparatively simple enzyme has been 
/discussed as a unique reaction. Polyketides of such complexity are usually catalyzed by bacterial polyketide synthases 
/which either belong to the type I (modular) or type II (subunit type) including the utilization of the acyl carrier protein 
/|CITS: [15044020]|.

COMMENT - Purified recombinant UGT73K1 catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to at least three
/different triterpene saponin aglycones in Medicago truncatula, namely hederagenin, soyasapogenol B
/and soyasapogenol E |CITS: [15743451]|. Though single products are formed in these reactions,
/the exact location of the glucosylation remains ambiguous. For instance, soyasapogenol B may
/be glucosylated on its C-3, C-22, and/or C-23 hydroxyl group by this enzyme. UGT73K1 does not
/appear to glycosylate two other prevalent triterpene sapogenins, medicagenate (medicagenic acid)
/and bayogenin in vitro, nor does not it catalyze reactions using UDP-galactose or UDP-glucuronic acid.
/It also fails to interact with a number of different phenolic acceptors, such as catechin, |FRAME:CPD-3141 genistein|,
/|FRAME:DAIDZEIN daidzein|, |FRAME: CPD-520 quercetin|, |FRAME:CPD-3402 (-)-medicarpin|, and|FRAME:BIOCHANIN-A biochanin-A| |CITS: [15743451]|.  
/
/UGT73K1 transcripts can be detected by RT-PCR in flowers, leaves, peticles, stems, and at somewhat
/higher levels in roots. Levels of transcripts also rise in dark-grown cell suspension cultures about 8
/hours after treatment with methyl jasmonate and remain high for up to 48 hours.
/This matches the pattern of induction for |FRAME: MONOMER-12196 &beta;-amyrin synthase|, an important upstream
/enzyme required for the formation of the sapogenin substrates of UGT73K1 |CITS: [15743451]|. 
/
/UGT73K1 appears to be a member of a new subfamily of UDP-glycosyltransferases |CITS: [15743451]|
/within the larger <A href="http://www.cazy.org/fam/GT1.html">Glycosyltransferase Family1</A>.

COMMENT - The cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (AtCAD) multigene family in Arabidopsis is composed of nine genes, with AtCAD C and D being previously associated to the lignification process in Arabidopsis thaliana |CITS: [15937231]|. Eudes et al. showed that another CAD isoform, CAD 1, was present in elongating stems, flowers, and siliques, using Western-blot analysis. In addition, a GUS reporter gene fused to the CAD 1 promoter indicated that its expression was associated to the primary xylem, in accordance with a potential role in lignification. A small reduction of lignin content could be observed in elongating stems of Atcad 1 T-DNA knockout mutant. In turn, CAD 1 fused to the AtCAD D promoter, complemented partly this mutant as revealed by the partial restoration of conventional lignin units and by the decrease in the frequency of beta-O-4 linked p-OH cinnamaldehydes. Thus, CAD 1 could be also involved in lignification of elongating stems of Arabidopsis thaliana |CITS: [16832689]|.

COMMENT - The monomeric isoflavone-O-methyltransferase (IOMT) has a pronounced specificity for methylation the 7-hydroxyl 
/group of daidzein <i>in vitro</i>, however it does not catalyze the 4-O methylation of the isoflavonoid nucleus which is  
/prerequisite for the formation of pterocarpan phytoalexins via formononetin. 
/
/It has been suggested that the isoflavone-O-methyltransferase colocalizes with the membrane-associated isoflavone 
/synthase to methylate the B-ring of the 2-hydroxyisoflavanone before being dehydrated to daidzein or genistein 
/|CITS: [11752378]|, although dehydration is usually regarded to be the precedent enzymatic step to methylation in this 
/enzymatic sequence.  
/
/Recently, it has been demonstrated, that there are two distinct O-methyltransferases involved in the pathway, one 
/(daidzein-7-O-methyltransferase - D7OMT) catalyzing the 7-O-methylation of daidzein forming isoformononetin and
/the other one (2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4'-O-methyltransferase - HI4'OMT) catalyzing the B-ring 4-O-methylation
/of 2-hydroxyisoflavanone to produce formononetin. |CITS: [12610212]| 
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-methyltranferase belongs to the first plant O-methyltransferases to be characterized by their 
/X-ray crystal structures - i.e. enzyme (IOMT)/product (SAH, isoformonetin) complex - revealing the detailed 
/catalytic sequence for methyl transfer in plants |CITS: [11224575]|

BASIS-FOR-ASSIGNMENT - :MANUAL
CITATIONS - 6639051
CITATIONS - 6497385
CITATIONS - Weidemann91
COMMENT - The malonylation of isoflavone glucosides has been suggested to be prerequisite for efficient passage of those 
/compounds through the tonoplast. Malonylation renders the isoflavone glucosides more water soluble, consequently 
/more suitable for vacuole storage. The malonylation step has been discussed as final step of the isoflavone conjugates 
/biosynthesis |CITS: [6639051]|.
/
/However, the isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase activity had been found strongly inhibited by 
/distinct isoflavone-specific malonylesterase and glucohydrolase activities in crude extracts of <i>Cicer arietinum</i>, 
/which rather points to the existence of an isoflavone conjugate cycle with a subcellular compartmentation of the 
/enzyme |CITS: [6497385]|.
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase shows a strong preference for isoflavones being 
/glucosylated at the 7-O-position of the A-ring. Best substrates are the 4'-methoxylated compounds 
/biochanin A-7-O-glucoside and formononetin-7-O-glucoside followed by the 7-O-glucosides of the 
/4'-hydroxylated isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Medicarpin and maackiain have not been used as substrates in 
/those experiments but their malonylglucosides are found as constitutive compounds in chickpea |CITS: [Weidemann91]|.
/
/Various 7-O-glucosylated flavones and flavonols could also be converted, however with a greatly decreased affinity for 
/the malonyltransferase. The 4'-O-glucosylated isoflavones could not act as acceptors, indicating that the 
/7-O-glucosylation is a precondition for isoflavone specific malonyltransferase activity |CITS: [6497385]|.
/
/The  isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase had a molecular weight of 112 kD. However, 
/other purified plant malonyltransferases acting on flavone/flavonol-7-O-glucosides or flavonol-3-O-glucosides 
/possess molecular weights of around 50 kD |CITS: [6639051]|. Therefore, a possible dimeric composition of the 
/chick pea enzyme has not yet been excluded.

COMMENT - The spinach 10-formyl-THF synthetase sequence |CITS: [1644815]| was used to screen the Arabidopsis dbEST

/amino acid sequence conserved in other 10-formyl-THF synthetases |CITS: [Skavdahl99]|. Unlike in other 
/eukaryotes, where a trifunctional enzyme (C1-THF-synthase) converts 10-formyl-THF to 5,10-methylene-THF, 
/plants have been shown to possess a monofunctional 10-formyl-THF synthetase. Furthermore, it has been 
/demonstrated that the C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathway (which includes the   10-formyl-THF synthetase) in 
/Arabidopsis can compensate for deficiency of serine when the primary glycine decarboxylase complex/serine 
/hydroxymethyltransferase (GDC/SHMT) pathway is disturbed |CITS: [12668769]|. 
/
/The 10-formyl-THF synthetase isolated from pea exhibited a strong preference for polyglutamylated substrates. 
/The affinity increased significantly from mono (Km = 40 uM) to pentaglutamylated THF (Km = 3 uM) |CITS: [Kirk94]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H) in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> has been isolated

COMMENT - The functional specificity of the isoflavone-7-O-glucoside &beta;-glucosidase of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> appears to be
/very similar to that of the &beta;-glucosidase found in <i>Glycine max</i>. 
/
/The &beta;-glucosidase is found throughout the plant as multiple molecular forms and constitutes especially in roots 
/a considerable portion of the extractable protein. 
/
/SDS electrophoresis revealed, that the enzyme consists of two subunits (~68 kD) and the isoelectric points of the 
/various species ranged between 5.9 and 7.1 The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside specific &beta;-glucosidase 
/showed two pH optima, a broad one from 7.0 - 7.5 with an additional minor optimum at 4.5 to 5.0, in contrast to most

COMMENT - The molecular function of one of previously identified cDNA clones representing cytochromes P-450 |CITS: [9648734]| 
/was found to encode a flavone-6-hydroxylase. The protein was recombinant expressed in yeast, microsomes isolated 
/and tested for substrate and binding affinities. The enzyme catalyzed a regiospecific monooxygenation at position 6 on 
/ring A of flavanone (eridictyol, isoliquiritigenin, naringenin) and to a lesser extent flavone such as apigenin and luteolin. 
/The enzyme does not discriminate between the 2S and 2R configurations of the flavanone. It belongs to the cytochrome 
/P450 subfamily CYP71D which members have so far been shown to be involved in indole alkaloid and monoterpenoid 
/biosynthesis. In combined studies with recombinant isoflavanone synthase (IFS) it has been demonstrated that the A-ring 
/hydroxylation occurs before the 2,3-aryl shift of the flavonoid B-ring |CITS: [11027686]|.

COMMENT - Using the cDNA isolated from <i>Ipomoea purpurea</i> as a probe the corresponding cDNA from 
/<i>Ipomoea nil</i> was obtained encoding the respective 3-O-glucoside 2-O''-glucosyltransferase (In3GGT). 
/The enzyme adds glucose to anthocyanidin 3-glucosides at the 2''-O-position of the glucose moiety forming 
/the corresponding sophorosides.  Its molecular function has been confirmed by recombinant expression of 
/the protein in <i>E. coli</i>. The enzyme accepts all three major anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides, including 
/delphinidin 3-O-glucoside as substrate even though the latter has not been found in any morning glory species. 
/In the contrary, the enzyme could not convert anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucosides although they have been 
/identified in dusky mutants of Ipomoea. It appears that the In3GGT gene is regulated by an MYB transcriptional 
/activator (C-1 protein). This factor has been found to be severely reduced in c-1 mutants coinciding with a 
/concomitant reduction of the expression of In3GGT |CITS: [15842621]|.

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding a pinoslylvin forming stilbene synthase (STS1) was isolated from wound and elicitor induced seedlings 
/of <i>Pinus strobus</i> using the STS of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> for screening the <i>P. strobus</i> cDNA library. The 
/protein was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and characterized. STS1 preferentially used cinnamoyl-CoA forming 
/pinosylvin and is therefore a pinosylvin synthase. In addition another unknown product was produced with cinnamoyl-CoA. 
/However the activity of STS1 only reached about 3 to 5% of the STS2 (|FRAME:CPLX-6966|) which represents another pinosylvin 
/synthase in white pine. It was shown that STS1 preferred a lower pH than STS2 and that one amino acid exchange in the 
/protein sequence was responsible for the different properties of STS1 and STS2 |CITS: [7698342]|.

COMMENT - Activity in dark grown cell cultures was observed only after induction with cell wall extracts of <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> (formerly <i>Phytophthora megasperma</i> f.sp. <i>glycinea</i>)
/or <i>Alternaria carthami</i>, and peaked 12-14 hours after induction.  
/Enzyme activity was characterized in the microsomal fraction of cell extracts.  Localization to the endoplasmic reticulum
/was determined by colocalization in a sucrose gradient of marmesin synthase activity with endoplasmic reticulum marker enzymes.

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding the cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase (CYP98A6) catalyzing the 3-hydroxylation of 
/4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactic acid (CHPL) to form caffeoyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactic acid was isolated from 
/<i>Lithospermum erythrorhizon</i> and recombinant expressed in yeast. The molecular function of the enzyme was 
/confirmed, and it was found that the enzyme was unable to hydroxylate caffeoyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactic acid forming 
/rosmarinic acid (RA). That clearly indicates that a second 3'-hydroxylase is necessary to carry out the making of the 
/final product RA. The expression of the CYP98A6 is significantly increased upon treatment with yeast extract and 
/methyl jasmonate and parallels the rosmarinic acid biosynthesis |CITS: [11943155]|.

COMMENT - The hydroxylation of 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan to 3,6a,9-trihydroxypterocarpan in soybean is carried out by a 
/cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase (CYP98A1 - accession number D83968), which has been isolated 
/from a elicitor-induced soybean cell culture |CITS: [9720921]|.
/
/The enzyme has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity |CITS: [2505672]| and could be successfully separated 
/during this process from another Cytochrome P450 enzyme (cinnamate-4-hydroxylase), which is the first report on 
/the separation of two cytochrome P450 enzymes from a higher plant. In addition, the glycoprotein nature of the enzyme 
/could be demonstrated by cross-reacting with biotinylated lectins in Western blot |CITS: [1731635]|.
/
/Hagman and coworkers |CITS: [6540173]| demonstrated the specificity of glyceollin accumulation in response to soybean 
/related pathogens. Although unrelated plant pathogens caused an increase of the early and more unspecific enzymes 
/involved in glyceollin biosynthesis, the glyceollin production itself was not affected by such a treatment. The results 
/indicated that the late enzymes in this pathway, including the 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-hydroxylase, may have 
/important regulatory functions in this pathway.
/
/The 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-hydroxylase (D6aH) from <i>Glycine max</i> exhibits a pronaunced stereo- and regiospecificity. 
/The enzyme only accepts (6aR,11aR)-enantiomers of 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan |CITS: [6540173]| |CITS: [9720921]|,
/confirming that hydroxylation proceeds with retention of configuration.
/
/The enzyme characterized here has been purified to apparent homogeneity, subsequently digested and microsequenced 
/yielding a unique amino acid sequence only found in CYP98A1. The CYP98A1 cDNA, coding for a protein with D6aH 
/activity, was functionally expressed in yeast and characterized. The significant difference regarding the substrate affinity 
/obtained with the recombinant protein (0,1 uM), the purified enzyme obtained soybean cell cultures (0,16 uM) |CITS: [9720921]|
/and the enzyme characterized from Hagmann and coworkers (1984) with an Km of 5,3 uM |CITS: [6540173]| remains to be 
/explained.
/
/At present, the experimental data obtained so far point to a enzyme different from the dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-hydroxylase 
/(D6aH) involved in pisatin biosynthesis |CITS: [Matthews87]|, which still remains to be further characterized on a biochemical 
/and molecular level.

COMMENT - The UDPG:coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferase (CAGT) was isolated and partially purified from developing xylem of 
/<i>Pinus strobus</i>. The enzyme has been purified from actively lignifying tissues as the accumulation of coniferin, 
/i.e. the highest activity of the CAGT coincides with events of wood formation such as the appearance of differentiated 
/tracheids undergoing secondary-wall formation and lignification |CITS: [Savidge98]| |CITS: [11430981]|. The partially 
/purified enzyme expressed high affinities towards coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol, as well as for their aldehydes and 
/dihydroconiferyl alcohol. The CAGT from <i>Pinus strobus</i> only accepts <i>trans</i>-configured substrates forming 
/the corresponding E-glucosides in contrast to the Z-glucosides found in <i>Fagus grandifolia</i> |CITS: [11537477]|.

COMMENT - Enzyme activity assay with crude protein extracts from stems and leaves indicated higher enzyme activity in stems. The 
/enzyme activity pattern of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase correlates well with the gene expression pattern of sam-1|CITS: [2535470]|.
/
/SAM1 is regulated by S-nitrosylation, a protein posttranslational modification. In vitro studies showed that covalent 
/binding of nitric oxide (NO) to Cys114 inhibits MAT1 activity|CITS: [16365035]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the 7-O specific glucosylation of flavanones has been partially purified from <i>Petunia x hybrida</i>. 
/Although <i>Petunia</i> (in contrast to the genus <i>Citrus</i>) is not known to accumulate flavanone glucosides, 
/such as prunin the corresponding glucosyltransferase activity has been located in leaves and to a lesser extend in 
/sepals. This has been discussed as the reflection of the existent flavonoid profile in <i>Petunia</i> where the key 
/compound naringenin is preferably channeled towards flavonol glucoside and anthocyanin biosynthesis whereas 
/<i>Citrus</i> metabolizes high amounts of flavanone mono- and diglycosides instead. The more than 10.000 times 
/higher sensitivity to UDP of the <i>Petunia</i> 7-O-glucosyltransferase in comparison to the <i>Citrus</i> enzyme 
/may also contribute to the observed different flavonoid pattern in those plants. Three 7-O-glucosyltransferase 
/activities could be isolated from <i>Petunia</i> with either high specificity towards flavanones (naringenin, hesperitin) 
/- this enzyme - or flavonoles (kaempferol, quercetin) and flavones (apigenin, luteolin) |CITS: [10626374]|. The 
/enzyme  glucosylated hesperitin at the 7-O-position with a 70% efficiency compared to naringenin.

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding a pinoslylvin forming stilbene synthase (PDSTS3) was isolated from seedlings of <i>Pinus densiflora</i>. 
/The protein was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized. The recombinant PDSTS3 activity 
/was comparable to the catalytic acitivity of STS2 from <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> |CITS: [7698342]| which was used as control. 
/In contrast to the other two stilbene synthases (PDSTS1 and PDSTS2) PDSTS3 lacks the common C-terminal extension 
/of STS. However, PDSTS3 expressed the highest catalytic activity of all <i>Pinus densiflora</i> STS's. The homodimeric 
/PDSTS3 preferred cinnamoyl-CoA producing pinosylvin but accepted in contrast to the <i>P. sylvestris</i> STS2 
/p-coumaryl-CoA as well (resveratrol production). PDSTS3 was insensitive to product inhibition (pinosylvin) which was 
/discussed as a possible factor in maintaining the balance between the stilbenoid and flavonoid biosyntheses 
/|CITS: [11880657]|.

CITATIONS - 9118956
COMMENT - The dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase/dihydropterin synthase (HPPK/DHPS) from <i>Pisum sativum</i> was isolated 
/from leaf mitochondria. The enzyme is bifunctional and combines activities catalyzing two consecutive steps to form 
/7,8-dihydropteroate from 6-hydroxymethyl-dehydropterin. HPPK/DHPS has a native molecular weight of 280 - 300 kDa 
/with identical subunits of 53 kDa, hence probably existing as a hexamer. The fact that enzyme activity could only be 
/detected in mitochondria and that a mitochondrial transit peptide was required for synthesis pointed to mitochondria as 
/the unique site of 7,8-dihydropteroate synthesis in plants. Mg<sup>2+</sup> was essential to the function of the 
/dihydropterin synthase domain of the enzyme |CITS: [9118956]|.

COMMENT - The sequence of the Arabidopsis PLA1, AtLCAT3, is highly homologous to animal lecithin:cholesterol 
/acyltransferase. However it does not show any acyltransferase activity when assayed in a yeast 
/transformation system. It has no activity towards triacylglycerol or cholesterol ester. The enzyme 
/specifically hydrolyzes phospholipids at the sn-1 position. Among phospholipids, the highest activity is 
/with phosphatidylcholine (PC). Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidate, and lysophosphatidylcholine 
/are hydrolyzed at 50%, 40% and 8% the rate of PC. The enzyme activity is not affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. 
/Yeast transformed with AtLCAT3 had a strong reduction of its phospholipid content, yet an increased level of lysophospholipid and free fatty acid.

COMMENT - ACOS5 (At1g62940) encodes a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. Mutant plants are severely compromised in pollen wall formation. In vitro substrate competition assay indicated that ACOS5 is a medium- to long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase with a preference for substituted fatty acids carrying a hydroxyl group at position C8 to C16. 
/
/Among the saturated fatty acids, ACOS5 showed clear preference for those of medium-chain length (C10 to C14), which competed nearly as well as oleic acid, whereas fatty acids of longer or shorter chain length competed less efficiently. 
/
/Among the hydroxy-octanoic acids, 8-hydroxy octanoic acid (8OH-C8) competed better than oleic acid whereas 2OH-C8 and 3OH-C8 were inactive. 
/
/Among the long-chain hydroxy fatty acids tested, 12OH-C18 and 16OH-C16 were the most efficient competitors, the latter exceeding the apparent effectiveness of oleic acid, whereas medium-chain hydroxy fatty acids (10OH-C10 and 12OH-C12) were again less active.

COMMENT - The enzyme glucosylating both the A-ring 4'-position of the 6'-deoxychalcone butein and the A-ring 6-position 
/of the 4-deoxyaurone sulfuretin has been isolated from petals of <i>Coreopsis grandiflora</i>. The resulting 
/products butein 4'-glucoside and sulfuretin 6-glucoside, respectively are both present in the plant and contribute 
/to the yellow flower coloration. In contrast to the corresponding enzyme characterized in <i>Dahlia variabilis</i> 
/|CITS: [Stich94]| the 6'-deoxychalcone 4'-glucosyltransferase (6'DC4'GT) of <i>Coreopsis grandiflora</i> did 
/only poorly use isoliquiritigenin as a substrate. The 6'-deoxychalcone 4'-glucosyltransferase (6'DC4'GT) did not 
/accept chalcones of the 6'-hydroxy-type but glucsylated the flavanones naringenin, eriodictyol and the flavones 
/apigenin and luteolin at the flavonoid A-ring 7-O-position |CITS: [Halbwirth97]|.

COMMENT - The dimeric (80 and 75 kD subunits) isoflavone-7-O-glucoside &beta;-glucosidase exhibits a pronounced specificity 
/towards glucose attached to the 7-O position of the flavonoid nucleus (biochanin A, formononetin, daidzein, genistein).
/Other compounds than isoflavones are much poorer substrates and isoflavones or flavonole being glucosylated at 
/the 3'- or 4'-O-position of the B-ring are not hydrolized at all |CITS: [240725]|. 
/
/It has been shown, that the 7-O-isoflavone specific &beta;-glucosidase of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> was able to hydrolyze 
/both the glucosyl and malonyl glucosyl isoflavones directly with similar kinetics |CITS: [11730862]|. This may reflect the 
/different biochemistry of the interconversion cycle in <i>Glycine max</i> compared to <i>Cicer arietinum</i>, since no 
/esterase activity for malonyl glucosides of daidzein and genistein could be detected in soybean. 
/
/However, the existence of such a curtailed isoflavone conjugate cycle remains to be demonstrated

COMMENT - The enzyme glyceollin synthase catalyzes the last committed step in glyceollin biosynthesis. The enzyme has been 
/characterized as an Cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase |CITS: [Welle88a]| converting the various glyceollidins 
/(I and II) into the corresponding glyceollins (I - III) by cyclization of the prenyl residue. 
/
/Is has been argued that there could be more than one cyclase enzyme present in soybean because the microsomal 
/fraction catalyzed not only cyclization of both 4- and 2-dimethylallyl-glycinols to glyceollin I and II with a 2,2-dimethylchromen 
/ring but also the formation of glyceollin III with a 2-isopropenyldihydrofuran ring  |CITS: [WELLE88A]|. However, to verify 
/this assumption implies the purification and separation of pathway specific Cytochrome P 450's, which has not yet achieved 
/for the glyceollin biosynthetic route and awaits further research.
/
/There are reports on other cyclases, e.g. isolated from the tropical legume <i>Tephrosia vogelii</i> |CITS: [Crombie86]|
/and the umbelliferous plant bishop's weed (<i>Ammi majus</i>) |CITS: [2828055]|. The results show that the cyclases, 
/involved in different pathways (furanocoumarins - |CITS: [2828055]|, rotenoids - |CITS: [Crombie86]| |CITS: [Welle88a]|),
/can be either a soluble enzyme (|CITS: [Crombie86]|) or a membrane-bound Cytochrome P450 (|CITS: [Welle88a]| 
/|CITS: [2828055]|.
/
/The soybean cyclase had a very broad pH optimum ranging from 7.5 to 9.5. The enzyme was inhibited by its final 
/product glyceollin. Glyceollin can accumulate to high concentrations (3mM) in infected soybean tissues but it was 
/discussed that this may not be the sites where the active biosynthesis takes place |CITS: [Welle88a]|.
/
/In agreement with findings of all the other specific enzymes involved in glyceollin biosynthesis, glyceollin synthase 
/was not present in unchallenged tissues but was induced rapidly upon elicitation with the glucan elicitor from 
/<i>P. megasperma</i> and yeast extracts. The activity profile of the cyclase parallels that of the prenylase, reaching 
/a distinct maximum after 24 hrs and slowly declining afterwards |CITS: [Welle88a]|.

COMMENT - While wild type tomato leaves exhibits a rapid and transient increase in JA accumulation in response to mechanical wounding, the ACX1A mutant produced little JA. It provided genetic evidence that ACX1A is required for the majority of wound-induced JA biosynthesis in leaves. The mutant was also compromised in wound-induced defense response.
/
/In vitro activity assay using recombinant ACX1A clearly demonstrated OPC8-CoA as a preferred substrate. In addition, OPDA was also metabolized by ACX1A |CITS: [15722469]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the attachment of malonic acid to the 6''-O-position of the glucose moiety of 
/delphinidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside, i.e. anthocyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside-6''-<i>O</i>-malonyltransferase 
/(3MAT) has been identified in crude extracts from petals of <i>Clitoria ternatea</i>. The 3MAT seems to 
/malonylate both anthocyanidins and flavonol 3-<i>O</i>-glucosides but demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> a clear 
/preference for anthocyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucosides. Its fairly strict substrate and strong donor specificity 
/implies a preference of the enzyme for glucosidic structures and a high affinity for malonyl-CoA. Investigation 
/of the malonyltransferase in color variations of <i>Clitoria ternatea</i> from mauve to white did not reveal 
/any significant differences with regard to the enzyme which is therefore not responsible for the obtained flower 
/color change. The enzyme did not accept anthocyanidins glucosylated at the 3' and 5' position (preternatins) 
/indicating that for the formation of ternatins the 3-<i>O</i>-glucosides of delphinidin have first to be malonylated |CITS: [16887235]|.

COMMENT - The MAM1 gene in Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia encodes a methylthioalkylmalate synthase which is able to condense 
/2-oxo-4-methylthiobutanoic acid with acetyle-CoA to form 2-(2'-methylthio)ethylmalic acid, when expressed in 
/E.Coli. The corresponding MAM1 allele in ecotype Landsberg is however not able to catalyze the same reaction. 
/The condensation reaction must be catalyzed by a different gene in Landsberg.
/
/The MAM1-encoded methylthioalkylmalate synthase catalyzes the condensation reactions of only the first two rounds of 
/methionine chain elongation in the biosynthesis of methionine-derived glucosinolates. The enzyme 
/requires a divalent metal ion and ATP (or ADP) for activity.
/
/The optimum pH is 8.5. The enzyme requires a divalent metal ion, such as Mn++, for activity.

COMMENT - The IpeOMT1 full length cDNA was expressed in E. coli, and the recombinant protein was purified. Enzyme assay indicated that IpeOMT1 is active towards both ipecac alkaloids and benzylisoquinoline alkaloids |CITS: [20061395]|. Among the ipecac alkaloids, the highest catalytic efficiency was found in 6-O methylation of 7-O-methyldeacetylisoipecoside, followed by 6-O-methylation of deacetylisoipecoside. The recombinant enzyme also had 6-O-methylation activity, but low, towards cephaeline.

COMMENT - Cell cultures of the old man cactus (<i>Cephalocereus senilis</i>) accumulate unusual B-ring unsubstituted flavonoids 
/upon elicitation, among them the aurone cephalocerone (|FRAME:CPD-7034|) |CITS: [PARE92]|. Two isoforms of chalcone 
/isomerase (CHI 1, CHI 2) exist in the cactus being able to convert both the 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone to naringenin 
/and 2',4',6'-trihydroxychalcone to pinocembrin. The existence of a hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase accepting both cinnamic 
/acid and p-coumaric acid and a chalcone synthase which catalyzes the formation of 2',4',6'-trihydroxychalcone from 
/cinnamoyl-CoA and 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone from p-coumaroyl-CoA complements the enzymes necessary for 
/the production of B-ring unsubstituted flavanoids in elicited or B-ring substituted flavonoid in unchallenged cell cultures of 
/<i>Cephalocereus senilis</i>. The CHI of chitin-elicited cell cultures was partially purified and its substrate specificity 
/towards 2',4',6'-trihydroxychalcone demonstrated |CITS: [7646065]|.

COMMENT - The cloned isoflavone synthase gene (IFS-Tp) from <i>Trifolium pratense</i> encodes a predicted 535 amino acid protein, 
/with strong homology to IFS's from other legumes. The enzyme activity essentially depends on a flavanone substrate,
/which satisfies the following prerequisites: a) a saturated C2-C3 bond (C-Ring), b) a 7-hydroxy group and c) the 
/absence of a 3-hydroxy group. 
/
/In accordance with the substrate sprectrum of other legume IFS's, naringenin (5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavanone), 
/liquiritigenin (7,4'-dihydroxyflavanone), 7-hydroxyflavanone and 5,7-dihydroxyflavanone is being transformed 
/to the corresponding isoflavones, but not flavones (flavone, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone), 4'-hydroxyflavanone and 
/6-hydroxyflavanone.

COMMENT - The dehydrogenase activity of the enzyme catalyzing the reduction of the double bond of artemisinic aldehyde 
/to form dihydroartemisinic aldehyde has been found in the 150.000 g supernatant extracted from young leaves 
/of <i>Artemisia annua</i>. The enzyme was only active in the presence of cofactors such as NAD/NADP. 
/The intermediates expected in the biosynthetic route towards artemisinin, i.e. artemisinic alcohol, artemisinic 
/aldehyde, dihydroartemisinic aldehyde and dihydroartemisinic acid, have been extracted and verified (GC-MS, nmr) 
/from the incubation mixture but could not be found in the absence of the cofactors. The enzyme activity converting 
/dihydroartemisinic aldehyde to dihydroartemisinic acid was also found but further experiments on the purification 
/of the enzyme(s) remain to be done |CITS: [15678372]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the formation of benzylbenzoate from benzylalcohol and benzoyl Coenzyme A 
/(benzoyl-coenzyme A:benzyl alcohol benzoyltransferase - BEBT) has been identified in <i>Clarkia breweri</i> 
/using BAHD-type (acyltransferase family) protein sequences to screen a <i>Clarkia breweri</i> cDNA 
/library. The obtained cDNA coding for a monomeric enzyme was recombinant expressed in <I<E. coli</i> 
/and its catalytic activity determined. Although BEBT could use a broad variety of substrates, some of 
/them with higher rates than the native substrate benzyl alcohol, the catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) revealed 
/the preference of BEBT for benzyl alcohol and benzoyl-coenzyme A |CITS: [12226525]|. Moreover, 
/benzoylbenzoate is a major volatile in <i>Clarkia breweri</i> |CITS: [9489012]| and no other volatiles of 
/this compound type have been identified in this plant. BEBT is mainly found in the stigma, which is also 
/the origin of the strongest emission of benzylbenzoate but is also significantly induced by wounding of 
/leaves |CITS: [12226525]|.
/
/It has been shown that the non-scented progenitor <i>Clarkia concinna</i> has the BEAT genes but does 
/not splice out the single intron in the transcripts. When the intron is spliced out the enzyme did not prefer 
/benzyl alcohol as the major substrate, indicating that post-transcriptional mechanisms may be involved in 
/the regulation of BEAT activity |CITS: [10588064]|.

COMMENT - In Vaccaria hispanica, the triterpene carboxylic acid glucosyltransferase UGT74M1 may be involved in
/the production of a number of different monodesmoside saponins |CITS: [17172290]|.  The UGT74M1
/enzyme falls into the L cluster of
/<A href="http://www.cazy.org/fam/GT1.html">glucosyltransferase family 1</A> |CITS: [11042215]|.
/Several different triterpene aglycones, including gypsogenin, gypsogenate,
/16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate, and quillaic acid can all be glucosylated in vitro by recombinant
/purified UGT74M1. NMR analysis confirmed that the C-28 carboxyl carbon of gypsogenin is the
/site of glucosylation. But, given the low levels of gypsogenin-derived monodesmoside saponins,
/it is unclear if this reaction is biologically-relevant. Quillaic acid also does not appear to be
/glucosylated in V. hispanica. However, the saponin profile of V. hispanica suggests that
/gypsogenate and 16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate are likely substrates for this enzyme in vivo,
/and that they are glucosylated on the C28 carbon |CITS: [17172290]|. 
/
/In vitro, UGT74M1 shows the highest activity with 16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate, and lower
/levels of activity with gypsogenate (56%), gypsogenin (12%), and quillaic acid (11%). Although
/the enzyme has a lower apparent Km for the latter two compounds, it also has much higher apparent
/Kcat values for the two biologically relevant substrates, 16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate and
/gypsogenate . Notably, UGT74M1 shows similar Kcat values for these two compounds, but it
/has a lower apparent Km for gypsogenate, assumed to be the primary substrate
/in vivo |CITS: [17172290]|. UGT74M1 does not appear to use UDP-fucose or UDP-glucuronic acid
/as glycosyl donors in vitro, suggesting that it not does add these sugars during the first stages
/of bidesmoside saponin formation in V. hispanica. In addition, the enzyme seems to have a
/preference for a subset of oleanane saponin aglycones, but it also shows some weak in vitro
/activity towards a lupane triterpenoid, betulinic acid. Magnesium does not appear to be required for
/UGT74M1 activity in vitro |CITS: [17172290]|.
/
/UGT74M1 appears to be expressed in the leaves and roots of V. hispanica, but not in flowers, germinating seeds, or
/developing seeds |CITS:[17172290]|.

COMMENT - In-vitro assay of crude cell extracts expressing APR1, APR2 or APR3 indicated that all three 
/isoenzymes have similar APS reductase activities. The enzyme activity with APS is 30- to 50-fold

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the 7-O specific glucosylation of naringenin and hesperitin has been partially purified 
/from seeds of <i>Citrus paradisi</i>. The richest source of the active enzyme has been found in the leaves of 
/that plant.  As reported from other plants such as <i>Petunia</i> |CITS: [10626374]| several 7-O-glucosyltransferase 
/activities could be isolated |CITS: [McIntosh90]| with one of them - this enzyme - expressing a high specificity 
/towards flavanones but not accepting other flavone or flavonol aglycones. The two flavanones naringenin and 
/hesperitin were glucosylated with comparable efficiency |CITS: [2171434]|. The question whether this results 
/from the activities of two enzymes not being separated during the purification process or a single enzyme activity 
/with broader substrate specificity remains to be clarified.

COMMENT - CYP71A13 is involved in camalexin biosynthesis. Camalexin level in CYP71A13 knock-out mutant plants was much lower than in wild type plants when infected with A. brassicicola.  CYP71A13 was heterologous expression in E.coli. In vitro assay from spheroplasts of CYP71A13-expressing E.coli showed that CYP71A13 was capable to dehydrate indole acetaldoxime to indole-3-acetonitrile [|CITS: [17573535]|. The dehydration reaction is not a redox reaction and therefore not a typical P450-catalyzed reaction.

COMMENT - While wild type tomato leaves exhibits a rapid and transient increase in JA accumulation in response to mechanical wounding, the ACX1A mutant produced little JA. It provided genetic evidence that ACX1A is required for the majority of wound-induced JA biosynthesis in leaves. The mutant was also compromised in wound-induced defense response.
/
/In vitro activity assay using recombinant ACX1A clearly demonstrated OPC8-CoA as a preferred substrate. In addition, OPDA was also metabolized by ACX1A.

COMMENT - The enzyme activity was detected from maize tissue extracts of shoot, root and endosperm. Molecular oxygen 
/is required for optimal enzyme activity. However none of the known types of oxidation enzymes including peroxidase, 
/mixed function oxygenase or dioxygenase are likely involved in the reaction since known cofactors are not effective

COMMENT - The S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(iso)eugenol O-methyltransferase (IEMT) was purified and sequenced from 
/petals of <i>Clarkia breweri</i>. The N-terminal sequence of the protein showed high similarity to a 
/S-adenosyl-l-methionine:caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) cDNA clone from aspen and was used to 
/screen a <i>Clarkia breweri</i> flower cDNA library. One of the clones, designated as IEMT1, was recombinant 
/expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and used to characterize and compare this enzyme with the purified plant IEMT 
/|CITS: [9159948]|.

/The enzyme was able to convert both eugenol and isoeugenol to their corresponding methyl esters but cannot 
/methylate chavicol. The enzyme is highly active in petals of freshly opened flowers, but it is also found to a smaller 
/amount in style and stamens |CITS: [9439593]| |CITS: [9159948]|. Non-fragrant lines of <i>Clarkia breweri</i> 
/did not have IEMT activities and no IEMT mRNA was found in any flower part of the plant indicating that the

COMMENT - The putative serine decarboxylase (AtSDC) cDNA from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> was isolated by searching for 
/sequence homologues to other amino acid decarboxylases in GenBank and characterized by expression in <i>E. coli</i>. 
/The function of the recombinant protein was verified by complementation of a yeast mutant that lacks phosphatidylserine 
/decarboxylase activity and depends on ethanolamine for phospholipid biosynthesis. The protein restored the wild-type 
/content of phophatidylethanolamine, proving that the recombinant enzyme catalyzed the decarboxylation of serine to 
/ethanolamine, which was subsequently incorporated into phospholipids via the Kennedy pathway bypassing the blocked 
/phosphatidylserine carboxylase. The serine decarboxylase was soluble and its activity was highly dependent on 
/pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), which clearly distinguish this protein from phosphatidylserine carboxylase, which is a 
/membrane protein that requires a pyrovoyl cofactor |CITS: [11461929]|. The protein is presumably a tetramer with a 
/native molecular weight of 210 kDa.

COMMENT - The serine decarboxylase activity was demonstrated in leaf extract of various plants. Spinach expressed the highest 
/activity, which could be further increased by salinization. That finding is in agreement with reports on activity changes 
/of other enzymes of this pathway |CITS: [10799484]| |CITS: [12232019]| exposed to environmental stress. The high 
/Km value for L-serine was discussed in correlation with the rather high concentration of serine (7.5 mM in illuminated 
/spinach leaves) found in the cytoplasmatic compartments of this and other plants |CITS: [11461929]|.

COMMENT - Cell-free extracts of <i>Citrus aurantium</i> have been shown to convert naringenin-7-O-glucoside (prunin) to 
/narirutin, i.e. naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. The L-rhamnose is transferred to the C-6 position of the glucose moiety 
/(1-6 binding) typical for the tasteless (non-bitter) compounds found in those members of the <i>Citrus</i> genus. 
/The enzymatic activity is extended towards hesperitin-7-O-glucoside forming the corresponding 6"-O-rhamnoside 
/neohesperidin. The enzymatic assay was carried out using an combined approach which included the exogenous addition 
/of UDP-glucose and NADPH to the crude extract allowing to form L-rhamnose (|FRAME:PWY-3261|). Although the 
/formation of the two flavanone 7-O-glucoside-6"-O-rhamnoside have been demonstrated the purification and

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding a novel polyketide synthase, i.e. p-coumaroyltriacetic acid synthase (CTAS) catalyzing the formation 
/of p-coumaroyl triacetic acid from p-coumaroyl-CoA and 3 molecules of malonyl-CoA was isolated from <i>Hydrangea 
/macrophylla.</i> The cDNA was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and its catalytic activity verified. The purified 
/enzyme is distinct from the homologous chalcone synthase or stilbene synthase in catalyzing neither the formation of 
/chalcone nor stilbene. The final product of this reaction p-coumaroyl triacetic acid lactone (CTAL) is most probably formed 
/by nonenzymatic cyclization |CITS: [10469148]|.

COMMENT - Plant glucosyltransferases are recognized to possess a pronounced capability to glucosylate a broad range of various 
/compounds, ranging from phenols, aromatic acids, coumarins, cyanogenic glucosides, glucosinolates  to flavonoids, 
/anthocyanins and monolignols. 
/
/The glucosylation of selected isoflavones is the first committed reaction towards the interconversion cycle of isoflavone 
/conjugates. The remarkable high specificity of the purified glucosyltransferase for such isoflavones underlines the 
/involvement of those conjugates in the flexible production of defense compounds in legumes |CITS: [6458246]|.
/
/The monomeric UDPG: isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase isolated from <i>Cicer arietinum</i> expressed a specifically 
/high catalytic potential to glucosylate the 7-O-position of isoflavones bearing a hydroxyl or methoxyl group at the 
/para - position of the B-ring. 
/
/The 4'-O-methylated isoflavones (biochanin A, formononetin) are the preferred substrates followed by the 
/4'-O-hydroxylated isoflavones (daidzein, genistein) with compareable lower turnover rates |CITS: [6458246]|.
/
/The glucosylation of hydroxyl substitutes isoflavones, flavones, flavanones, flavanols, coumarins, cinnamic acids, and 
/benzoic acids could not be catalyzed at all. Biochanin A and formononetin are the main phenolic constituents in chick 
/pea roots indicating that the isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase may have been adapted in legumes in both a tissue 
/and substrate specific manner.

COMMENT - There are two families of acyl-ACP thioesterase, FatA and FatB. Substrate specificity of these isoforms 
/determines the chain length and level of saturated fatty acids in plants. The highest activity of FatA is 
/with C18:1-ACP. FatA has very low activities towards other acyl-ACPs when compared with C18:1-ACP. 
/FatB has highest activity with C16:0-ACP. It also has significant high activity with C18:1-ACP, followed 
/by C18:0-ACP and C16:1-ACP. Kinetics studies of the Arabidopsis FatA and FatB indicate that their 
/substrate specificities with different acyl-ACPs came from the Kcat values, rather than from Km. The Km 
/values of the two isoforms with different substrates are similar, in the micromolar order. Domain swapping 
/of FatA and FatB indicates the N-terminus of the isoforms determines their substrate specificities.

COMMENT - The cDNA (RhGT1) encoding a novel anthocyanidin 5,3-O-glucosyltransferase has been isolated from petals 
/of <i>Rosa hybrida</i> and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. Both the crude enzyme and the recombinant 
/enzyme catalyze the dual glucosylation of cyanidin first generating the 5-O-glucoside followed by the glucosylation 
/of the 3-O-position at the C-ring. The substrate specificity expressed by the enzyme was well defined. The cyanidin 
/aglycone or cyanidin 5-O-glucoside were accepted but not cyanidin 3-O-glucoside verifying the metabolic sequence 
/from 5-O-glucoside to 3-O-glucoside. As for many other genes coding for enzymes involved in flower pigmentation 
/RhGT1 was temporally and spatially regulated during flower development |CITS: [15944692]|.

COMMENT - There are two families of acyl-ACP thioesterase, FatA and FatB. Substrate specificity of these isoforms 
/determines the chain length and level of saturated fatty acids in plants. The highest activity of FatA is 
/with C18:1-ACP. FatA has very low activities towards other acyl-ACPs when compared with C18:1-ACP. 
/FatB has highest activity with C16:0-ACP. It also has significant high activity with C18:1-ACP, followed 
/by C18:0-ACP and C16:1-ACP. Kinetics studies of the Arabidopsis FatA and FatB indicate that their 
/substrate specificities with different acyl-ACPs came from the Kcat values, rather than from Km. The Km 
/values of the two isoforms with different substrates are similar, in the micromolar order. Domain swapping 
/of FatA and FatB indicates the N-terminus of the isoforms determines their substrate specificities.

CITATIONS - 11115895
COMMENT - The Arabidopsis phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEAMT) was isolated by complementation of a yeast 
/mutant (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae opi3</i>) lacking the methyltransferase steps along the phosphatidyl-base 
/pathway necessary for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in yeast. Sequence comparison revealed that the 
/isolated cDNA from Arabidopsis was not homologous to any yeast phospholipid N-methyltransferase but was rather 
/similar to other classes of methyltransferases. Although the complemented yeast accumulated phosphatidylcholine, 
/the amount was distinctive lower than that of the yeast wild type. It was demonstrated that the pathway, leading to PC 
/had been modified. The methylation steps were not carried out at the phosphatidyl-base level but instead at the 
/phospho-base level. This resulted in the accumulation of phosphethanolamine which in return constitutes a substrate 
/for the consecutive steps leading to PC via the CDP-choline pathway, albeit to a lesser extent. It has been demonstrated 
/that the PEAMT could methylate all three phospho-base compounds, converting phosphoethanolamine with the 
/highest efficiency of 13.4 nmol/min/mg protein and dimethylphosphoethanolamine with 8.5 nmol/min/mg protein. The 
/enzyme localization points to the cytoplasm as shown by hydropathy analysis, which is different from the 
/membrane-bounded (ER) phospholipid N-methyltransferases (PLMT's) of yeast |CITS: [11115895]|.

COMMENT - Arabidopsis genome has nine functional genes encoding acyl-CoA synthetase. LACS6 and LACS7 are peroxisome-located. The substrate specificity of the two acyl-CoA synthetases was further characterized with heterologously expressed proteins. The results indicate that both enzymes are capable to activate the naturally occurring fatty acids stored in the Arabidopsis seeds. 
/
/LACS7 is more active than LACS6. LACS7 has similar activities towards fatty acids with chain length of C14 to C18. Its activity with C18:1 fatty acid is 2-3 times higher than with the rest of long chain fatty acids. The activities towards medium chain length (from C6 to C12) are 25% to 50% less compared to C14.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the transesterification of coumaroyl/caffeoyl-CoA and 4-hydroxy-/3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid 
/to form 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactonic acid/rosmarinic acid, respectively was partially purified from cell cultures of 
/<i>Coleus blumei</i> |CITS: [Petersen88]|. The enzyme was named rosmarinic acid synthase (RAS) and is active towards 
/several substrates resulting in either the endproduct of the pathway rosmarinic acid or intermediates of this pathway. The 
/RAS only accepts the R(+)-stereoisomers of the corresponding substrates. The enzyme readily catalyzes the reverse 
/reaction forming caffeoyl-CoA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid from rosmarinic acid. 3,4-dimethoxyphenyllactate and 
/phenyllactate were no acceptable substrates for the RAS indicating that a free 4-hydroxyl group seems to be essential for 
/the RAS activity. The preferred substrates for the RAS catalyzed reaction were coumaroyl-CoA and 4-hydroxyphenyllactate 
/resulting in 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate. The name rosmarinic acid synthase is misleading in this case but was 
/kept since it refers to the first observed formation of rosmarinic acid with caffeoyl-CoA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactate

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding the flavonol 7-O-glucosyltransferase (AtGT-2)) has been cloned from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 
/and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The molecular function as 7-<i>O</i>-glucosyltransferase, i.e. 
/attaching glucose to the 7-<i>O</i>-position of flavanones, flavanols and flavones was confirmed. The AtGT-2 
/showed broader substrate specificity with the highest affinities towards eriodictyol (100%), luteolin (92%), 
/kaempferol (79%), naringenin (71%) and quercetin (64%) |CITS: [16794327]|.  However, since flavonoid 7-<i>O</i>-glucosides 
/have not yet been reported in Arabidopsis but the occurrence of flavonol 7-<i>O</i>-rhamnoside is well 
/documented |CITS: [12900416]| it has been proposed that the <i>in vivo</i> substrate of AtGT-2 might actually 
/be rhamnose.

COMMENT - The UDPG:coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferase (CAGT) was isolated and partially purified from developing xylem of 
/<i>Pinus strobus</i>. The enzyme has been purified from actively lignifying tissues as the accumulation of coniferin, 
/i.e. the highest activity of the CAGT coincides with events of wood formation such as the appearance of differentiated 
/tracheids undergoing secondary-wall formation and lignification |CITS: [Savidge98]| |CITS: [11430981]|. The partially 
/purified enzyme expressed high affinities towards coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol, as well as for their aldehydes and 
/dihydroconiferyl alcohol. The CAGT from <i>Pinus strobus</i> only accepts <i>trans</i>-configured substrates forming 
/the corresponding E-glucosides in contrast to the Z-glucosides found in <i>Fagus grandifolia</i> |CITS: [11537477]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding the flavonol 7-O-glucosyltransferase (AtGT-2)) has been cloned from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 
/and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The molecular function as 7-<i>O</i>-glucosyltransferase, i.e. 
/attaching glucose to the 7-<i>O</i>-position of flavanones, flavanols and flavones was confirmed. The AtGT-2 
/showed broader substrate specificity with the highest affinities towards eriodictyol (100%), luteolin (92%), 
/kaempferol (79%), naringenin (71%) and quercetin (64%) |CITS: [16794327]|.  However, since flavonoid 7-<i>O</i>-glucosides 
/have not yet been reported in Arabidopsis but the occurrence of flavonol 7-<i>O</i>-rhamnoside is well 
/documented |CITS: [12900416]| it has been proposed that the <i>in vivo</i> substrate of AtGT-2 might actually 
/be rhamnose.

COMMENT - Isoflavone synthase (IFS), a Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP93C2), catalyzes the key entry point step of 
/isoflavone biosynthesis. IFS and flavanone 2-hydroxylase (F2H) compete for the same substrate (2S)-flavanone 
/leading the phenolic metabolism into divergent pathways, isoflavone and flavone/retrochalcone biosynthesis, respectively.
/
/The Cytochrome P450 enzyme obtained from the cDNA library of elicited <i>Glycorrhiza echinata</i> cells catalyzes 
/the stereoselective aryl migration of flavanones to yield 2-hydroxyisoflavanones, a unique reaction among Cyt P450's. 
/The recombinant enzyme heterologously expressed in yeast cells, converted liquiritigenin and naringenin into the 
/corresponding 2-hydroxyisoflavanones |CITS: [10557230]|. 
/
/The P450 mRNA of IFS accumulated transiently upon elicitation of the licorice cells in agreement with the other enzymes 
/involved in the defense pathway (pterocarpan phytoalaexin), which have also been strongly induced after pathogenic 
/attacks |CITS: [3072693]| |CITS: [GRISEBACH78]|.

COMMENT - An epithiospecifier protein (ESP) from Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Ler, has been purified after heterologous expression in E. coli. Since the substrates of ESP, thiohydroximate-O-sulphonates, are unstable, the activity of ESP was assayed with glucosinolates in the presence of myrosinase. The Arabidopsis ESP catalyzes the conversion of alkenylglucosinolates to epithionitriles, whereas nonalkenylglucosinolates were converted to simple nitriles. Aromatic benzylglucosinolates were not substrates of ESP. 
/
/The Arabidopsis ESP is completely inactive in citrate and phosphate buffers. The highest activity was found in Mes buffer at pH 6.0. Both Fe2+ and Fe3+ are co-factors that promote ESP activity. The optimum concentration of Fe2+ is 0.5 mM. Chelators of Fe2+ or Fe3+, such as bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid and deferoxamine, strongly inhibit ESP activity. ESP activity is completely blocked by addition of 2 mM EDTA. On the other hand, the enzyme activity is increased by addition of dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol. 
/
/It was also observed that without ESP, myrosinase and Fe2+ are sufficient to convert glucosinolates to simple nitriles.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid/ 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (AtbioF) has been isolated 
/from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana.</i> The enzyme catalyzes the transamination of pimeloyl-CoA (carboxyhexanoyl-CoA) to 
/8-amino-7-oxononanoate, the entry reaction of the biotin biosynthesis. The enzyme was recombinant expressed in 
/<i>E. coli</i> and its molecular function confirmed by means of functional complementation in a mutant <i>E. coli</i> strain. 
/The monomeric enzyme is a cytosolic protein indicating that the biotin biosynthesis in plants is compartmented |CITS: [16299174]|.

COMMENT - The &delta;1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) purified from barley has both proline dehydrogenase and 
/&delta;1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase activities. However, the proline dehydrogenase activity disappears 
/at pH below 8.5. Thus the enzyme functions as a P5C reductase in vivo. 
/
/The enzyme uses both NADH and NADPH as electron donors but has the highest activity with NADPH. 
/
/The reaction towards the synthesis of proline and NADP+ is irreversible. 
/
/The optimum pH for the P5C reductase activity is between 6.8 and 7.5.

COMMENT - Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) catalyzes the reversible conversion of 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate 
/and glycine to form serine and tetrahydrofolate. It was demonstrated that this enzyme possesses a second 
/catalytic activity converting 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate to 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate in the presence of 
/glycine as shown for isolated SHMT from rabbit liver and <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [2201683]| |CITS: [1536856]|. The 
/SHMT prefers polyglutamylated substrates (Km = 40 uM) to monoglutamylated substrates (140 uM). This enzyme 
/is thought to be the main catalyst for 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF) formation in plants. 
/The role of 5-CHO-THF in the C1-metabolism still remains to be solved. 5-CHO-THF is the most stable natural 
/folate and the only one that does not serve as a cofactor in one-carbon metabolism. Instead, 5-CHO-THF is a 
/potent inhibitor of SHMT and most other folatedependent enzymes in vitro and thought to be regulated by 
/5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase during photorespiration |CITS: [8480361]| |CITS: [15888445]|.

COMMENT - A novel prenyl side-chain elongation enzyme was identified in Sophora flavescens cell culture |CITS: [14551337]|. The enzyme transfers a dimethylallyl group to the 2"-position of another dimethylallyl group in leachianone G. It was a membrane-bound enzyme which required Mg2+ and utilized dimethylallyl as the sole prenyl donor. The 2'-hydroxy group in leachianone G is necessary for 2"-prenyltransfering. Similar flavanones lacking the 2'-hydroxy group, such as 8-dimethylallylnaringenin was not prenylated by this enzyme.

COMMENT - The monomeric UDPG: isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase isolated from Cicer arietinum expressed a specifically 
/high catalytic potential to glucosylate the 7-O-position of isoflavones bearing a hydroxyl or methoxyl group at the 
/para - position of the B-ring. 
/
/The 4'-O-methylated isoflavones (biochanin A, formononetin) are the preferred substrates followed by the 
/4'-O-hydroxylated isoflavones (daidzein, genistein) with compareable lower turnover rates. The glucosylation of 
/hydroxyl substitutes isoflavones, flavones, flavanones, flavanols, coumarins, cinnamic acids, and benzoic acids 
/could not be catalyzed at all. 
/
/Biochanin A and formononetin are the main phenolic constituents in chick pea roots indicating that the 
/isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase may have been adapted in legumes in both a tissue and substrate specific 
/manner.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the 7-O specific glucosylation of naringenin and hesperitin has been partially purified from 
/seeds of <i>Citrus paradisi</i>. The richest source of the active enzyme has been found in the leaves of that plant.  
/As reported from other plants such as <i>Petunia</i> |CITS: [10626374]| several 7-O-glucosyltransferase activities 
/could be isolated |CITS: [McIntosh90]| with one of them - this enzyme - expressing a high specificity towards 
/flavanones but not accepting other flavone or flavonol aglycones. The two flavanone aglycones naringenin and 
/hesperitin were glucosylated with comparable efficiency |CITS: [2171434]|. The question whether this results from 
/the activities of two enzymes not being separated during the purification process or a single enzyme activity with 
/broader substrate specificity remains to be clarified.

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding the pinosylvin-3-O-methyltransferase (PMT) was isolated from an ozone-challenged <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> 
/seedling cDNA library. The enzyme was purified and sequenced |CITS: [Chiron98]| and several cis-regulatory elements 
/have been recognized to be interactive during the expression of the gene |CITS: [11027734]| in response to various 
/stresses such as ozone and pathogens. The dimeric PMT belongs to a multigene family in Scots pine where each member 
/might be differentially regulated upon environmental stimuli |CITS: [Chiron98]|. The PMT from <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> 
/exhibits a broader substrate affinity and methylated stilbene aglycones with free OH groups at position 3 ring-A, e.g. resveratrol

COMMENT - The optimum pH is between 9.0 and 9.5. The enzyme is highly specific for succinate semialdehyde. It does not use 
/formaldehyde, propionaldehyde, glycerine aldehyde, or ethanol. It has very low activity towards acetaldehyde and 
/glutaraldehyde. With respect to succinate semialdehyde, the enzyme does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 
/The K<sub>0.5</sub> for succinate semialdehyde is 15 uM. The enzyme exclusively uses NAD+ as a cofactor. The 
/enzyme activity of SSADH1 is regulated by adenine nucleotides. AMP is a competitive inhibitor with respect to NAD+. 
/The Ki is 2.9 mM. ADP is a mixed-competitive inhibitor. Both K<sub>ic</sub> and K<sub>iu</sub> are in the millimolar 
/range. ATP is a noncompetitive inhibitor. The K<sub>ic</sub> is 2.5 mM and the K<sub>iu</sub> is 8 mM. 
/
/SSADH1 knockout mutants are sensitive to heat and UV stress. Both UV and heat cause rapid increase of reactive 
/oxygen|CITS: [12740438]|.

COMMENT - Two cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases involved in late hydroxylation steps towards the formation of rosmarinic 
/acid have been identified in microsomes of <i>Coleus blumei</i>. It has been established through inhibitory studies that the 
/hydroxylation of the 3- and 3'-postion in the phenolic rings of 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate and derivatives 
/is not catalyzed by phenolases, potentially being able to carry out this reaction. In contrast, known cytochrome P450 
/inhibitors such as cytochrome c, ancymidol, metyrapone, miconazole, juglone and tetcyclacis significantly decreased the

COMMENT - The cDNA (Dv3MaT) encoding the anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside-6"-O-malonyltransferase in <i>Dahlia variabilis</i> 
/was isolated and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The purified enzyme catalyzed the malonyl-CoA-dependent 
/malonyl transfer to pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside to produce pelargonidin 3-O-6"-O-malonylglucoside. In addition, 
/transgenic Petunia lines harboring Dv3MaT accumulated cyanidin 3-O-6"-O-malonylglucoside-5-O-glucoside and 
/cyanidin 3-O-6"-O-malonylglucoside which had not been found in the host plants before. It has been shown that 
/the 6"-O-malonylation contributed to both stability of the pigment and increased resistance against &beta;-glucosidase

COMMENT - The dimeric (80 and 75 kD subunits) isoflavone-7-O-glucoside &beta;-glucosidase exhibits a pronounced specificity 
/towards glucose attached to the 7-O position of the flavonoid nucleus (biochanin A, formononetin, daidzein, genistein). 
/Other compounds than isoflavones are much poorer substrates and isoflavones or flavonole being glucosylated at 
/the 3'- or 4'-O-position of the B-ring are not hydrolized at all |CITS: [240725]| 
/
/It has been shown, that the 7-O-isoflavone specific &beta;-glucosidase of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> was able to 
/hydrolyze both the glucosyl and malonyl glucosyl isoflavones directly with similar kinetics |CITS: [11730862]|. This may
/reflect the different biochemistry of the interconversion cycle in <i>Glycine max</i> compared to <i>Cicer arietinum</i>, 
/since no esterase activity for malonyl glucosides of daidzein and genistein could be detected in soybean. 
/
/However, the existence of such a curtailed isoflavone conjugate cycle remains to be demonstrated.

COMMENT - Flavanone-3&beta;-hydroxylase catalyzing the Fe(II)/oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylation of (2S)/(-)-flavanones to 
/(2R, 3R)/(+)-dihydroflavanols (flavanonols) has been purified from <i>Petunia x hybrida</i> |CITS: [2154946]|. The 
/cDNA encoding the enzyme was isolated from petunia petals and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> confirming 
/the molecular function and essential cofactors needed for the enzymatic reaction (ferreous ions, 2-oxoglutarate, ascorbate, 
/molecular oxygen) |CITS: [1544919]|. The enzyme readily undergoes proteolysis in crude extracts and on expression 
/in <i>E. coli</i> which hampers the exact determination of enzyme properties. It had been found that the responsible 
/protease most likely cleaves the Glu 337-Leu 338 bond resulting in the loss of a small carboxy-terminal portion which 
/seems to be essential for the enzyme activity |CITS: [10700394]|. This finding was corroborated by using C-terminally 
/truncated enzyme forms which indeed were accompanied by the gradual loss of enzyme activity but without influence 
/on the substrate specificity. The petunia flavanone-3&beta;-hydroxylase preferred naringenin as a substrate to form 
/dihydrokaempferol but the conversion of pinocembrin to pinobanksin or eriodictyol to taxifolin was also exhibited with 
/high efficiency |CITS: [15013767]|.

COMMENT - Two isoforms of NADP phosphatase have been isolated from caryopses of <i>Avena sativa</i> being involved in 
/different developmental stages of the embryo. One of the isoforms with a molecular weight of 160 kDa is highly 
/active in dormant caryopses expressing a rather specific activity towards NADP forming NAD. This high NADP hydrolyzing 
/activity in dormant caryopses versus the rather week activity in after-ripening caryopses and the diminished activity of 
/this enzyme in embryos grown at low temperature was discussed as a regulative measure to slow down the biosyntheses 
/involved in growth |CITS: [10944152]|.

COMMENT - The formation of 6-hydroxymellein is carried out by the 6HM synthase, a multifunctional polyketide enzyme |CITS: [8424647]| 
/|CITS: [1879555]|. The fully active enzyme (homodimer) catalyzes 2 reactions; the condensation of 1 acetyl-CoA and 
/4 malonyl-CoA forms the pentaketamethylene chain and the NADPH dependent ketoreduction at the triketide intermediate 
/stage finalizes the formation of the dihydroisocoumarin skeleton |CITS: [2806265]|. 
/
/Although the organization of 6-HM synthase resembles certain types of fatty acid synthases this specific polyketide synthase 
/differs in various aspects. Unlike fatty acid synthase the 6-HM synthase is not inhibited by cerulenin, a potent inhibitor of  
/fatty acid synthases |CITS: [KUROSAKI94]| and the two SH-groups at the reaction center (cysteine-SH and the 
/4'-phosphopantetheine-SH of ACP) belong to the same subunit and are not contributed from the other subunit as shown 
/in fatty acid synthases |CITS: [8638933]|.
/ 
/Both identical monomer subunits are aligned in a head-to-tail direction to form two complete reaction centers |CITS: [12423879]|. 
/The monomers contain functional domains of the ketoreduction and acyl condensation, but only the condensation reaction 
/is functional in the dissected monomer |CITS: [7639527]|.  
/
/In absence of NADPH or when the active homodimer is dissected into monomeric subunits triacetic acid lactone is liberated 
/as a derailment product. The interruption of the keto-reducing reaction prevents the further condensation of malonyl-CoA 
/producing the triketide product instead of 6 HM |CITS: [2806265]| |CITS: [8638933]|.
/
/The enzyme possesses a transacylase like domain functioning as the primary binding site of the co-substrate(s). Both 
/acetyl- and malonyl moieties bind to the Ser residue of this domain and the acyl groups are channeled properly to the two 
/SH groups of the condensation domain of either Cys-SH or cysteamine-SH attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP), prior 
/to the initiation of the condensation reaction |CITS: [8638933]| |CITS: [8566239]|.  
/
/It also has been demonstrated that free coenzyme A is an important allosteric factor for the activity of 6-HM synthase 
/enhancing the ketoreduction reaction mediated by NADPH |CITS: [12423879]| |CITS: [KUROSAKI99A]| |CITS: [KUROSAKI99B]|
/but inhibited by NADH |CITS: [11164583]|. The ketoreduction is the rate-limiting step of the 6-hydroxymellein synthesis |CITS: [8424647]| 
/which is suggested to be due to the change of microstructure at the reaction center caused by the association of free CoA 
/with the enzyme |CITS: [KUROSAKI99A]|.

COMMENT - Starting from 4-coumaryl-CoA and malonyl-CoA the biosynthesis of glyceollin involves nine enzymatic steps, which 
/have all been characterized |CITS: [Grisebach89]|. The final steps in the pathway to glyceollin involve prenylation and 
/cyclization of prenyl residue.
/
/The membrane-bounded dimethylallylpyrophosphate: trihydroxypterocarpan dimethylallyl transferase (DMAPP 
/prenyltransferase) carries out the prenylation of 3,6a,9-trihydroxypterocarpan to produce glyceollidin I and II in comparable 
/biosynthetic steps to the formation of phaseollins |CITS: [Zahringer79]| |CITS: [Zahringer81]|. Based on the enzymatic yield 
/of the two isomers (2- and 4-dimethylallyl-trihydroxypterocarpans) and their natural occurrence in soybean plants the 
/existence of two prenyltransferases has been proposed |CITS: [Zahringer81]|, a finding which could not be corroborated 
/to date.
/
/The limited distribution of prenyltransferases has resulted in a smaller number of plants being able to synthesize complex 
/isoflavonoids. The prenylated pterocarpans are even restrictively distributed throughout the legumes |CITS: [Tahara95]|.
/The presence of prenyltransferases was demonstrated in white lupine |CITS: [443825]| and bean |CITS: [Biggs87]| 
/producing both induced (e.g. bean) and constitutive (lupine) antifungal complex isoflavonoids involved in the plant's 
/defense response.
/
/The soybean enzyme has been partially purified using different detergents enabling to carry out a refined study on the 
/enzyme's properties. Three detergents, Chaps, dodecylmaltoside (DOM) and 1-dodecyl-2-deoxy-phosphatidylcholine 
/(ES12H) were used and gel permeation chromatography of solubilized prenyltransferase eluted  molecular weights of 
/440 000 in DOM, 300 000 in ES 12H and above 1.500 000 in Chaps |CITS: [Welle91]|.
/
/It was shown that the homoallylic isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) was not just unable to replace dimethylallylpyrophosphate 
/(DMAPP) but was in addition an efficient competitive inhibitor (Ki = 7.5 uM) of prenyltransferase activity |CITS: [Welle91]|.
/
/The intracellular location of prenyltransferases involved in both glyceollin (soybean) and phaseollin (bean) biosynthesis 
/has been pinpointed to the chloroplast inner envelope membrane using sucrose- and Percoll-gradient centrifugation. In 
/conclusion a movement of isoflavonoid intermediates between cell membranes was proposed, where the di- and trihydroxylated 
/pterocarpans (DHP, THP) are transferred to the plastids for prenylation and returned to the endoplasmatic reticulum for 
/subsequent cyclization |CITS: [Biggs90]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the final step from isoflavanones to pterocarpans  |CITS: [Bless88]| has been named 
/pterocarpan synthase (EC 1.1.1.246). The corresponding enzymatic acitity in alfalfa has been shown to involve in fact 
/two enzymes (a reductase and a dehydratase), which is probably also true for the enzymatic conversion in chickpea.
/
/Elicitors strongly induced the pterocarpan specific enzymes resulting in a five-fold higher amount of phytoalexins 
/(medicarpin, maackiain) in a resistant cell culture of chickpea |CITS: [Daniel90]|. In contrast, those enzymes were only
/slightly induced in susceptible cell cultivars of chickpea, pointing to the relevance of pterocarpans as inducible 
/phytoalexins in plant defence. 
/
/The pterocarpan synthase, an enzyme located within the pterocarpan pathway section, was induced slowly without a 
/pronounced optimum. The increased activity could still be measured 48 hours after the elicitation. The enzymes 
/located at the entrance of a pathway  section (e.g. isoflavone-2' and 3'- hydroxylases) are characterized by sharp, 
/transient maxima, descending in activity 12 hours after elicitation |CITS: [Daniel90]|. The results  point to a differential 
/regulation of the activities of the early and the specific enzymes.

COMMENT - Sreening of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenized Arabidopsis seedlings checked for altered sinapate ester 
/biosynthesis identified a mutant accumulating sinaopylglucose instead of sinapoylmalate. The mutant was called sng1
/(sinapoylglucose accumulator 1). As demonstrated for the sinapoylglucose:choline sinapoyltransferase (SNG2) the 
/gene encoded a serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) protein catalyzing a transesterification (formation of sinapoylmalate) 
/instead of expressing a typical hydrolase activity. It has been suggested that SCPL proteins may function in a broad 
/range of biochemical pathways expressing recruited enzymatical traits from ancestral catalysts of primary metabolism 
/|CITS: [10948250]|. The sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase (SMT) was shown not to cluster with the other 
/enzymes (SCT, sinapine esterase) of the sinapate ester pathway. The sng1 deletion mutants did neither affect the 
/functionality of those enzymes nor could any functional redundancy be detected.
/
/At least five more genes affect the developmentally regulated sinapate ester biosynthesis in Arabidopsis as identified 
/by screening of mutants with altered UV phenotype |CITS: [11779811]|. Among them four Reduced Epidermal Fluorescence 
/(REF) loci that reduced leaf sinapoylmalate content and one Bright Trichomes 1 (BRT1) locus that leads to modest 
/reductions in sinapate ester content but more notably elevates the levels of sinapate esters in certain trichomes.
/
/Analysis of the SMT sequence |CITS: [10948250]| and research on isolated protoplasts |CITS: [Strack85]| indicated a

COMMENT - The sinapoylglucose:choline sinapoyltransferase (SCT) was isolated and characterized from Arabidopsis by means of
/a mutant, which accumulates sinapoylglucose in place of sinapoylcholine. However, the overall sinapate ester content
/in wildtype and mutant plants was nearly unchanged. The mutant phenotype was named sng2 (sinapoylglucose 
/accumulator 2) reflecting the changed biochemical trait. The SNG2 gene was cloned using map-based and candidate 
/gene approaches |CITS: [11696189]|. 
/
/The enzyme was characterized as a serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) protein. As such the enzyme unexpectedly
/acted not as hydrolase that uses proteins and peptides as substrate but it catalyzes the transesterification reaction 
/for the formation of sinapoylcholine. The enzyme was partially purified and characterized from both Arabidopsis seeds
/and heterologous expressed proteins in <i>E. coli</i>. The recombinant protein was present in inclusion bodies and 
/had to be isolated, denaturated and refolded for enzyme activity |CITS: [11696189]|.
/
/It was argued, that this enzyme is not obligatory for providing choline during the growth phase of Brassicacea seedlings 
/as proposed by Strack |CITS: [Strack81]|. The obtained mutant sng2, devoid of sinapoylcholine, did not affect germination 
/or seed development, indicating that sinapoylcholine may not be a required storage form for choline in Arabidopsis 
/|CITS: [11696189]|.

COMMENT - Nonleguminous plants isomerize only 6'-hydroxychalcone to 5-hydroxyflavanone (referred to as Typ I) whereas 
/leguminous plants convert both 6'-deoxychalcone and 6'-hydroxychalcone to 5-deoxyflavanone and 
/5-hydroxyflavanone (referred to as Typ II). 
/
/In <i>Lotus japonicus</i> three isoenzymes (plus a putative fourth isoenzyme) have been identified to carry out 
/the cyclization of the 6'hydroxy- and 6'deoxychalcones towards flavanones and isoflavones, representing enzymatic 
/activities of both types.
/
/LjCHI2 was reactive only to naringenin chalcone, with the Vmax of 6.900 nkat x mg-1. The apparent Km was 3 uM, 
/with an pH optima of 7.5 to 8.0.

COMMENT - The mimosine synthase uses O-acetyl-L-serine as a specific alanyl donor. Neither O-phospho-L-serine nor L-serine could be used as a substrate. The enzyme could however use O-succinyl-L-serine and O-sulpho-L-serine but at a less extent when compared to O-acetyl-L-serine. In addition to mimosine, the enzyme is also able to synthesize &beta;-pyrazole-1-ylalanine, &beta;-3-amino-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylalanine, and O-ureidoserine using the corresponding heterocyclic donors . It cannot synthesize quisqualate, willardiine, or isowillardiine.

COMMENT - The cDNA of the monomeric, bifunctional dihydrofolat reductase (DHFR)/thymidylate synthase (TS) was isolated
/and sequenced from a <i>Glycine max</i> seedling cDNA library. In conformation with other plant DHFR-TS the 
/polypeptide contained two domains, with the DHFR section located in the N-terminal and the TS activity located 
/in the C-terminal region. DHFR is regarded as an important mediator of intracellular metabolism by generating 
/tetrahydrofolate, the one-carbon carrier coenzyme involved in the biosynthesis of building blocks for DNA and 
/other essential cell components. TS is the only enzyme known to catalyze the formation of thymidylate and therefore 
/critical for DNA biosynthesis in relation to the cell cycle. The cDNA was transformed into <i>E. coli</i> where the
/two enzyme activities have been confirmed |CITS: [7742362]|.

COMMENT - The conversion of isochorismic acid (but not chorismic acid) and &alpha;-ketoglutarate in the presence of thiamine diphosphate 
/to o-succinylbenzoate (OSB) was observed in protein extracts obtained from cell cultures of <i>Galium mollugo</i> 
/|CITS: [Simantiras91]| |CITS: [Simantiras89]|. OSB has been isolated from <i>Galium mollugo</i> cell cultures indicating 
/that this intermediate in the menaquinone/phylloquinone biosynthesis naturally occurs in plants |CITS: [Simantiras91a]|. 
/The aromatization leading to OSB is a multistep reaction sequence where first a stable intermediate, 
/i.e. 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (SHCHC) is formed. SHCHC is further enzymatically 
/converted to OSB under loss of water, but this reaction can also occur on a limited scale spontaneously under acidic 
/conditions |CITS: [Simantiras91]|.

COMMENT - The S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(iso)eugenol O-methyltransferase (IEMT) was purified and sequenced from 
/petals of <i>Clarkia breweri</i>. The N-terminal sequence of the protein showed high similarity to a 
/S-adenosyl-l-methionine:caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) cDNA clone from aspen and was used to 
/screen a <i>Clarkia breweri</i> flower cDNA library. One of the clones, designated as IEMT1, was recombinant 
/expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and used to characterize and compare this enzyme with the purified plant IEMT 
/|CITS: [9159948]|. 
/
/The enzyme was able to convert both eugenol and isoeugenol to their corresponding methyl esters but cannot 
/methylate chavicol. The enzyme is highly active in petals of freshly opened flowers, but it is also found to a smaller 
/amount in style and stamens |CITS: [9439593]| |CITS: [9159948]|. Non-fragrant lines of <i>Clarkia breweri</i> 
/did not have IEMT activities and no IEMT mRNA was found in any flower part of the plant indicating that the 
/emitting part of the plant is also the location of the volatile cinnamoic esters biosynthesis |CITS: [9159948]|.
/
/
/It has been demonstrated that the specificity of the catalytic activity is restricted to 7 amino acid residues discriminating 
/substrate and methylation regiospecificity of both COMT or IEMT |CITS: [10415125]|.
/
/The recombinant protein methylated eugenol/isoeugenol with the following kinetic parameters |CITS: [9439593]|:
/
/Km eugenol = 30 uM	Km isoeugenol = 74 uM	Km SAM = 27 uM
/
/The plant purified protein methylated eugenol/isoeugenol with the following kinetic parameters |CITS: [9439593]|:

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding for the anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5-GT) in <i>Perilla frutescens</i> was 
/isolated and recombinant expressed in yeast. The molecular function was shown to express 
/anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase activity converting anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside to anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucoside. 
/The best <i>in vitro</i> substrate was cyanidine 3-O-glucoside followed by delphinidin 3-O-glucoside and 
/pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside. Some activity was also observed towards anthocyanidin-3-O-acylglucoside. The 
/investigation of red and green forms of <i>Perilla frutescens</i> revealed that the 5-GT gene was specifically 
/expressed in the leaves of the red form, but not in those of the green form. The expression of the 5-GT gene 
/was induced by illumination with white light. |CITS: [10066805]|.

COMMENT - A 4-hydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase (HBD) activity was detected in cell-free root extracts of carrot. The enzyme activity was NAD+ dependent. The HBD activity was increased by methyl jasmonate treatment. In the treated root cells, HBD activity was nearly 9-fold higher than in the control cells. Interestingly, the activity of the first enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway that converts phenylalanine to 4-coumarate, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), was also found to be induced by methyl jasmonate treatment. PAL activity in the treated root cells was about 6-fold higher than in the control cells.

COMMENT - The Arabidopsis CCD7 catalyzes a specific asymmetric 9,10-cleavage of beta-carotene to produce beta-ionone (C13) and 10'-apo-beta-carotenal (C27). 10'-apo-beta-carotenal is further cleaved by CCD8 to yield 13'-apo-beta-carotenone (C18) and a C9 dialdehyde. Lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin or neoxanthin were not accepted as substrates by CCD7.  
/
/CCD7 and CCD8 are likely to catalyze the initial steps in the synthesis of a carotenoid-derived signal molecules regulating lateral branching. CCD7 and CCD8 mutants (max3 and max4) display a dramatic increase in lateral branching |CITS: [15342640]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the 3-hydroxylation of the 6'-deoxychalcone isoliquiritigenin to form butein has been 
/isolated from petals of <i>Dahlia variabilis</i>. The enzyme has been located to the microsomes. Further 
/experiments carried out (specific inhibitors) suggest the enzyme to be a cytochrome P450-dependent 
/monooxygenase. The other enzyme considered to be involved in the pathway, flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase, did not 
/accept isoliquiritigenin as tested in <i>Matthiola incana</i> and <i>Dianthus caryophyllus</i> indicating that

/linoleic acid also accumulated greater level of punicic acid than those without
/linoleic acid, again demonstrating the "conjugase" activity. In addition,
/transformed yeast cells accumulated 16:2&Delta;9cis,12cis and

COMMENT - A fourth member of the small gene family encoding the 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (AtCL5) in 
/<i>Arabaidopsis thaliana</i> has been identified and characterized. The enzyme was recombinant expressed 
/in <i>E. coli</i> and its molecular function, the activation of hydroxycinnamic acids to form the corresponding 
/CoA esters verified. In sharp contrast to the three other isozymes encoding for 4CL this enzyme expressed 
/its highest affinity towards sinapate |CITS: [14769935]|, a property which is only shared with one other 4CL 
/isolated from <i>Glycine max</i> |CITS: [11856365]|. The substrate specificity of the enzyme has been 
/discussed with regard to processes of sinapate activation outside lignin biosynthesis since it has been 
/shown that the formation of the monolignol sinapyl alcohol occurs via a different biosynthetic route |CITS: [14729911]|.
/Six other members of this family (At4CL4, At4CL6-10) were unable to convert any of the substrates into the 
/corresponding CoA ester |CITS: [16099486]|.

/the 3-aromatic acylation with caffeic and p-coumaric acid for both anthocyanidin 3- glucosides and 
/anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucosides |CITS: [10845463]|. The purified enzyme from <i>Perilla frutescens</i> leaves 
/prefers the monoglucosylated anthocyanins over the diglucosylated anthocyanins with only little effect regarding 
/the number of hydroxyl groups on the B-ring |CITS: [Fujiwara98]|. The enzyme was significantly inhibited 
/after applying diethylpyrocarbonate and N-ethylmaleimide to the incubation indicating that histidine and cysteine 
/residues are important for the activity |CITS: [10845463]|.

COMMENT - CYP79B2 was expressed in E.coli. Subsequent feeding of the transformed E.coli strain with C14-Trp clearly 
/demonstrated that tryptophan is the specific substrate of CYP79B2 and indole-3-acetaldoxime is the specific 
/product. An experiment over-expressing CYP79B2 in Arabidopsis and subsequent feeding with a tryptophan 
/analog indicated CYP79B2 depletes tryptophan in-vivo. CYP79B2 has a chloroplast transit peptide and is thus 
/predicted to be chloroplast-located.

COMMENT - Among the four functional myrosinase genes in the Arabidopsis genome, TGG1 is primarily expressed in leaves, whereas TGG4 and TGG5 are expressed specifically in roots. cDNAs of TGG1, TGG4 and TGG5 were heterologously expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris. The enzyme activities were assayed using the glucosinolate sinigrin as substrate |CITS: [19703694]|. The enzyme efficiencies of TGG1, TGG4 and TGG5 were similar, with the Kcat/Km values of 53, 48 and 85 s<sup>-1</sup>mM<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.

COMMENT - The cDNA of CYP704B1 was expressed in yeast cells. The enzyme activity of CYP704B1 was demonstrated in an in vitro enzyme assay, where palmitate was transformed to 16-hydroxypalmitate. In addition to palmitate, CYP704B1 also acted on oleate, linoleate, linolenate and 9,10-epoxystearate. Laurate was a poor substrate. Phenolics such as cinnamate, p-coumarate, ferulate, sinapate and p-coumaroyl shikimate were not metabolized by CYP704B1. 
/
/CYP704B1 had an anther-specific expression pattern and is highly coexpressed with CYP703A2, an in-chain fatty acid hydroxylase involved in exine biosynthesis.  CYP704B1 mutant plants had impaired pollen walls that lack a normal exine layer.

COMMENT - Isoflavone synthase (IFS), a Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP93C1v2), catalyzes the key entry point step of 
/isoflavone biosynthesis. IFS is stereoselective and executes a reaction that is unique among Cyt P450's, a 2,3 aryl 
/ring migration of flavanones to the presumed intermediate 2-hydroxyisoflavanone. In a second step this intermediate 
/is dehydrated to  introduce a double bond between C-2 and C-3, forming the corresponding isoflavone.  
/
/It is not clear whether dehydration can take place non-enzymatically <i>in vitro</i>, or results from an endogenous 
/dehydratase activity <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [Hakamatsuka98]|. IFS is competing with other enzymes of the 
/phenylpropanoid pathway, which causes problems  of flux partitioning between flavonol (F3H) and isoflavone (IFS) 
/biosynthesis at the level of naringenin.
/
/The 7-hydroxy group has been proposed to act as an anchor of the substrate by interacting with the &epsilon;-amino
/acid group of Lys 375 at CYP93C2, which is essential for the aryl migration.|CITS: [12207646]|
/
/Isolated genes from soybean (IFS1 and IFS2), expressed in the root epidermis and root hairs, have been shown to be
/controlled in a tissue-specific manner in response to nodulation and defense signals. IFS genes have recently been 
/cloned from a number of plant species, and production of isoflavones can be now achieved in non-legumes 
/(<i>Arabidopsis thaliana, Beta vulgaris, Nicotiana tabacum, Zea mays</i>) by recombinant DNA approaches.

COMMENT - The enzyme glyceollin synthase catalyzes the last committed step in glyceollin biosynthesis. The enzyme has been 
/characterized as an Cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase |CITS: [Welle88a]| converting the various 
/glyceollidins (I and II) into the corresponding glyceollins (I - III) by cyclization of the prenyl residue. 
/
/Is has been argued that there could be more than one cyclase enzyme present in soybean because the microsomal 
/fraction catalyzed not only cyclization of both 4- and 2-dimethylallyl-glycinols to glyceollin I and II with a 
/2,2-dimethylchromen ring but also the formation of glyceollin III with a 2-isopropenyldihydrofuran ring |CITS: [Welle88a]|. 
/However, to verify this assumption implies the purification and separation of pathway specific Cytochrome P 450's, 
/which has not yet achieved for the glyceollin biosynthetic route and awaits further research.
/
/There are reports on other cyclases, e.g. isolated from the tropical legume <i>Tephrosia vogelii</i> |CITS: [Crombie86]| 
/and the umbelliferous plant bishop's weed (<i>Ammi majus</i>) |CITS: [2828055]|. The results show that the cyclases,
/involved in different pathways (furanocoumarins - |CITS: [2828055]|, rotenoids - |CITS: [Crombie86]|), can be either a 
/soluble enzyme |CITS: [Crombie86]| or a membrane-bound Cytochrome P450 (|CITS: [Welle88a]| |CITS: [2828055]|). 
/
/The soybean cyclase had a very broad pH optimum ranging from 7.5 to 9.5. The enzyme was inhibited by its final product 
/glyceollin. Glyceollin can accumulate to high concentrations (3mM) in infected soybean tissues but it was discussed that 
/this may not be the sites where the active biosynthesis takes place |CITS: [Welle88a]|. 
/
/In agreement with findings of all the other specific enzymes involved in glyceollin biosynthesis, glyceollin synthase 
/was not present in unchallenged tissues but was induced rapidly upon elicitation with the glucan elicitor from 
/<i>P. megasperma</i> and yeast extracts. The activity profile of the cyclase parallels that of the prenylase, reaching a
/distinct maximum after 24 hrs and slowly declining afterwards |CITS: [Welle88a]|.

COMMENT - Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) from Arabidopsis thaliana was isolated using eukaryotic MTHFR's. Two cDNA's have been isolated (AtMTHFR-1 and AtMTHFR-2), shown to encode proteins catalyzing the reductive conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF). 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in turn is needed as the methyl donor for methionine biosynthesis from homomethionine. In contrast to mammalian ethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, plant MTHFR's strongly prefer NADH over NADPH (98% loss of activity). AdoMet, inhibitory to the human MTHFR, does not effect or even increases plant MTHFR activity. The dimeric enzyme was found to be cytosolic catalyzing a reversible reaction, which has been discussed as reason for the absence of the allosteric inhibition by AdoMet. Maintaining an pool of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate en route from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate ensures thymidylate and purine biosynthesis without the need of a regulatory mechanism |CITS: [10593891]|.

COMMENT - Isoflavanones formed from isoflavones represent the last isoflavonoid intermediates in the biosynthesis of 
/pterocarpans (|CITS: [Dewick94]|. The soluble, monomeric enzyme catalyzing this step, isoflavone reductase (IFR), also 
/determines the stereochemistry of the final pterocarpans.
/
/The chickpea IFR requires a 2'-hydroxyl group and either a 4'-methoxy or 4',5'-methylendioxy substitution on 
/the B-ring of the isoflavones |CITS: [Tiemann87]||CITS: [1915347]|. The isoflavones 2'-hydroxyformononetin 
/and 2'-hydroxypseudobaptigenin involved in the biosynthesis of medicarpin and maackiain, respectively, are 
/converted to their corresponding (3R)-isoflavanones, hence introducing chirality into the pterocarpan molecules. 
/
/The stereospecifity of this reaction has been investigated in cell suspension cultures of <i>Cicer arietinum</i>, suggesting 
/that the enzyme catalyzes the <i>trans</i>-addition from H(A) of NADPH to the C-2 atom of 2'-hydroxyformonetin yielding an 
/isoflavanone (3R-vestitone) with opposite absolute configurations |CITS: [Schlieper90]|
/
/The partially purified enzyme of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> |CITS: [Tiemann87]| had a temperature optimum of 35 to 40 centigrade.

COMMENT - An acyl-ACP delta4 desaturase activity was detected in the endosperm of Coriandrum sativum. Ectopic expression of a cDNA of the enzyme in tobacco resulted in the accumulation of 16:1delta4 in the acyl-ACP pool. The enzyme does not have an absolute specificity for 16:0-ACP. Short- and medium-chain fatty acids can also be accepted.

COMMENT - The acetyl-coenzyme A:acetyl alcohol acetyltransferase (BEAT) was purified to apparent homogeneity  
/from petals of <i>Clarkia breweri</i>. Petals have been shown to be the floral organs with the highest 
/activity of this enzyme which is in addition developmentally and differentially regulated |CITS: [9489012]|. 
/Peptide sequences of the protein were used to construct an oligonucleotide fragment which in turn was 
/used to screen a <i>Clarkia breweri</i> floral cDNA library. Southern blot suggested that BEAT is a single
/copy gene. The isolated cDNA encoding BEAT was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and the protein 
/used to compare substrate specificity with the plant purified BEAT |CITS: [9628024]|. Both enzymes were 
/catalytically active and converted benzylalcohol to benzylacetate, the major volatile ester in the 
/moth-pollinated <i>Clarkia breweri</i>. However, the enzyme expressed a broader substrate acceptance 
/catalyzing the acylation of cinnamylalcohol, 2 phenylethanol, and 2 naphthalene ethanol to some extend.

COMMENT - Bilberry and blueberry fruits contain high amounts of anthocyanins. A high proportion of delphinidin-derived 
/glycosides accounts for the dark blue to black color of the berries |CITS: [10956111]|.  The expression of the 
/gene encoding anthocyanin synthase and four other genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis have 
/been investigated in wild type and mutant bilberries lacking the bluish color. The mutant had significantly 
/decreased levels of anthocyanidin synthase mRNA which resulted in the lack of delphinidin and myricetin-derived 
/anthocyanins and the production of quercetin and proanthocyanidins instead |CITS: [12376640]|.

COMMENT - Purification procedure of the cucumber enzyme showed a major activity peak of 66 kDa and a minor peak of 12.6 kDa. The minor peak was speculated of being a peptide fragment during the purification which retained the catalytic activity domain. The enzyme activity was not affected by EDTA and many metal ions, except that Ca2+ is significantly inhibitory. The enzyme has a narrow optimum pH of 6.2. Very little activity can be detected above pH 6.5.

COMMENT - The optimum pH is 8.0-8.5. The Km for L-galactono-1,4-lactone is 3.3 mM. Substrate inhibition was observed when L-galactono-1,4-lactone concentration reached 32.6 mM. Cytochrome c is the only electron acceptor. Neither FAD, NAD, NADP, nor molecular oxygen is able to serve as the electron acceptor for the enzyme. The enzyme does not need metal for activity. Lycorine was reported to be a specific inhibitor of ascorbic acid biosynthesis and was shown to inhibit L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase of other plant species |CITS: 11337405[]|. The cauliflower enzyme is not inhibited by lycorine.

COMMENT - Using the cDNA isolated from <i>Ipomoea purpurea</i> as a probe the corresponding cDNA from 
/<i>Ipomoea nil</i> was obtained encoding the respective 3-O-glucoside 2-O''-glucosyltransferase (In3GGT). 
/The enzyme adds glucose to anthocyanidin 3-glucosides at the 2''-O-position of the glucose moiety forming 
/the corresponding sophorosides.  Its molecular function has been confirmed by recombinant expression of 
/the protein in <i>E. coli</i>. The enzyme accepts all three major anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides, including 
/delphinidin 3-O-glucoside as substrate even though the latter has not been found in any morning glory species. 
/In the contrary, the enzyme could not convert anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucosides although they have been 
/identified in dusky mutants of Ipomoea. It appears that the In3GGT gene is regulated by an MYB transcriptional 
/activator (C-1 protein). This factor has been found to be severely reduced in c-1 mutants coinciding with a 
/concomitant reduction of the expression of In3GGT |CITS: [15842621]|.

COMMENT - The 4'-O-methylation of 2'-hydroxyisoflavanones leading to 4'-methylated intermediates (e.g. formononetin, biochanin A) 
/crucial for the production of defensive compounds (pterocarpan phytoalexins) is a long standing problem, which has 
/not been unambiguously resolved. It has been suggested, that the isoflavone-7-O-methyltransferase (IOMT) through 
/its intracellular compartmentation with other enzymes of the pterocarpan biosynthetic pathway could produce the 
/4'-O-methylester |CITS: [11752378]|, however biochemical evidence has not yet been presented.
/
/A cDNA encoding a new enzyme (SAM: 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4'-O-methyltransferase - HI4'OMT) has been
/obtained through screening of functional expressed licorice cDNAs, which catalyzes the formation of formononetin but
/excluding daidzein as an intermediate |CITS: [12610212]| |CITS: [11129614]|. Instead a different enzyme 
/(daidzein-7-O-methyltransferase - D7OMT) has been demonstrated to be responsible for the formation of 7-O-methyldaidzein 
/(isoformononetin).
/
/The HI4'OMT of <i>Glycorrhiza echinata</i>, partially purified and separated from the D7OMT, clearly distinguish between 
/substrates, accepting only 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone but not daidzein |CITS: [12610212]|. The reaction product 
/2,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone is further dehydrated and gives rise to formononetin |CITS: [15734910]|. The 
/findings indicate that those enzymatic steps represent the biosynthetic sequence leading to 4'-methoxylated compounds, 
/which altogether constitute ca 50% of naturally occurring isoflavonoids |CITS: [Dewick94]|.
/
/A full-length HI4'OMT cDNA from <i>Lotus japonicus</i> was sequenced and the biochemical features of the obtained 
/enzyme fully corresponded to the HI4'OMT of <i>Glycorrhiza echinata</i>, confirming the functionality throughout the 
/legume family. It also shared the highest amino acid identity (83%) with <i>Glycorrhiza echinata</i> HI4'OMT |CITS: [12610212]|.

COMMENT - The expression of the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> gene At3g11480 was induced by both biotic and abiotic
/treatment and thought to be involved in plant defense mechanism by emitting volatile benzenoid esters. 
/The cDNA clone of the gene was functionally expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and its functions as SAM:benzoic 
/acid-salicylic acid carboxymethyltransferase (AtBSMT1) demonstrated |CITS: [14617060]|. The enzyme 
/belongs to the SABATH family |CITS: [DAURIA03]| and its expression correlates perfectly with methylsalicylate 
/emission when stress is applied to the plant. The enzyme is a homodimer of about 91 kDa. The pH optimum
/lies between 7 and 8.
/
/AtBSMT1 is highly expressed in flowers but is also found at lower levels in leaves and stems. The catalytic 
/efficiency of AtBSMT1 with salicylic acid was about 50% higher than with benzoic acid |CITS: [14617060]|. 
/The strong expression of AtBSMT1 after wounding, alamethicin and methyl jasmonate treatment and 
/<i>Plutella xylostella</i> herbivory supports the possible role of this enzyme in direct plant defense.

COMMENT - The Lotus japonicus enzyme had significant homophytochelatin synthase activity when homoglutathione was present in the assay buffer either as the sole substrate, or as a cosubstrate with glutathione. Its homophytochelatin synthase activity was about 50% of its phytochelatin synthase activity. In addition to heavy metals such as Cd2+, the enzyme is also activated by physiologically relevant metal ions such as Cu2+, Zn2+ and Fe3+ |CITS: [16489135]|. 
/
/Interestingly, although the Arabidopsis plants accumulate only phytochelatins not homophytochelatins, the Arabidopsis phytochelatin synthase was shown to also have homophytochelatin synthase activity in vitro |CITS: [16489135]|.

COMMENT - In bacteria, the biosynthesis of diacylglyceroltrimethylhomoserine (DGTS), a betaine lipid, involves two steps catalyzed by two enzymes. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the two reactions are catalyzed by a single bi-functional enzyme, encoded by BTA1. When the Chlamydomonas BTA1 cDNA was expressed in E. coli, DGTS was found to accumulate in E. coli.

COMMENT - A NDPase was isolated from onion root tip. The NDPase activity required Mg2+, Mn2+ or Ca2+. Among the tested nucleoside diphosphates, UDP was hydrolyzed at the greatest rate, with the rate of hydrolysis of GDP and IDP being 85% and 70% that of UDP. CDP, ADP and TDP were hydrolyzed at a much lower rate.

COMMENT - The enzyme activity catalyzing the N-methylation of nicotinic acid to form trigonelline has been identified in a 
/crude extract of <i>Pisum sativum</i> seeds. It has been shown that nicotinamide was involved in the biosynthetic 
/route to trigonelline serving as a precursor for nicotinic acid. In contrast to the metabolism observed in animals 
/nicotinamide was rapidly hydrolyzed to nicotinic acid (nicotinamidase) and itself not N-methylated. It has been 
/proposed that trigonelline may serve as storage of nicotinic acid for subsequent utilization in pyridine nucleotide 
/biosynthesis |CITS: [13790768]|.

COMMENT - A NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 was detected in the microsomes prepared from Euphorbia lagascae developing seeds. It exclusively converted free linoleic acid to cis-12(S),13(R)-epoxy-cis-9-octadecenoic acid (the vernolic acid isomer found in Euphorbia lagascae). Interestingly, a peroxygenase was also detected in the same microsome preps. It converted free linoleic acid to a mixture of 9,10-monoepoxide, 12,13-monoepoxide, and diepoxide. It also converted free oleic acid to 9,10-epoxystearate. The peroxygenase activity was dependent on the presence of cumene hydroperoxide.

COMMENT - The tyrosine hydroxylase catalyzing the formation of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) from tyrosine under requirement 
/of pteridin coenzymes such as 6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin and 6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin 
/was partially purified from cell cultures of <i>Portulaca grandiflora.</i> The enzyme also requires certain divalent cations for its 
/activity such as Mg2+, Fe2+ and Mn2+ but, on the other side was inhibited by Cu2+ and Zn2+. The enzymatic activity of tyrosine 
/hydroxylase could be separated from concomitant polyphenolase activities found in <i>Portulaca grandiflora</i>. In higher plants 
/the tyrosine hydroxylase represents a new enzyme different from polyphenol oxidase and tyrosinase reported to be involved in 
/similar enzymatic steps |CITS: [Yamamoto01]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was identified from a cDNA library of |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| induced <i>Catharanthus roseua</i> cultured cells. The cDNA was expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized with regard to molecular function and catalytic properties. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UGT3) was able to catalyze the 1,6-glucosylation of 
/|FRAME: CPD1F-453 kaempferol-3-glucoside| to yield |FRAME:CPD-14847 kaempferol-3-gentiobioside|. 
/
/UGT3 only exhibited activity with |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| and catalyzed the 1,6-addition of |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| to another |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| molecule, hence forming gentiosides of varying length. UGT3 transcripts were only detected in leaves of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>.  The <i>in vivo</i> function of UGT3 as kaempferol glucosyltransferase remains to be shown as kaempferol gentiosides have not yet been reported from <i>Catharanthus</i> indicating another or additional function of the glucosyltransferase in xenobitics detoxification |CITS:[19561332]|.

COMMENT - Chalcone isomerase (CHI) catalyze the cyclization of 42',4'-trihydroxychalcone (isoliquiritigenin) to 
/4',7-dihydroxyflavanone (liquiritigenin). As part of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway of plants CHI is ubiquitous in 
/all plants studied. The enzyme is also responsible for the isomerization of 4,2',4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone (naringenin 
/chalcone) into naringenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavanone). 
/
/The enzyme exists as a monomer and catalyzes the formation of (2S)-flavanone over 100,000-fold faster than to the 
/(2R)-flavanone, indicating that the enzyme is highly stereoselective.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase shows a strong preference for isoflavones being 
/glucosylated at the 7-O-position of the A-ring. 
/
/Best substrates are the 4'-methoxylated compounds biochanin A-7-O-glucoside and formononetin-7-O-glucoside 
/followed by the 7-O-glucosides of the 4'-hydroxylated isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Various 7-O-glucosylated 
/flavones and flavonols could also be converted, however with a greatly decreased affinity for the malonyltransferase. 
/The 4'-O-glucosylated isoflavones could not act as acceptors, indicating that the 7-O-glucosylation is a precondition 
/for isoflavone specific malonyltransferase activity. 
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase had a molecular weight of 112 kD. However, other purified 
/plant malonyltransferases acting on flavone/flavonol-7-O-glucosides or flavonol-3-O-glucosides possess molecular 
/weights of around 50 kD |CITS: [6639051]|. Therefore, a possible dimeric composition of the chick pea enzyme has not
/yet been excluded.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase isolated from chick pea acts specifically with isoflavone 
/malonylglucosides and is different from unspecific (synthetic) acylhydrolases being active with naphtyl or phenyl esters. 
/
/Ultrafiltration indicated a unusual high molecular weight around 300 kD, however it has been shown that the enzyme 
/aggregates with membrane material. SDS gel electrophoresis resulted in a single subunit of 32 kD.  
/
/It has been demonstrated, that the enzyme <i>in vivo</i> binds to membrane structures which may be necessary to 
/achieve full enzyme activity. The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase is different from other 
/plant esterases being insensitive to most of the usual esterase inhibitors. However, Hg2+ and p-hydroxmercuribenzoate 
/did efficiently inhibit the reaction.

COMMENT - Two cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases involved in late hydroxylation steps towards the formation of rosmarinic 
/acid have been identified in microsomes of <i>Coleus blumei</i>. It has been established through inhibitory studies that the 
/hydroxylation of the 3- and 3'-postion in the phenolic rings of 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate and derivatives is not 
/catalyzed by phenolases, potentially being able to carry out this reaction. In contrast, known cytochrome P450 inhibitors such 
/as cytochrome c, ancymidol, metyrapone, miconazole, juglone and tetcyclacis significantly decreased the enzymes activities. 
/The 4-coumaroyl-4'hydroxyphenyllactate 3-hydroxylase (4CHPL-3-H) catalyzes both the introduction of a hydroxyl group 
/in positions 3 of the aromatic ring in 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate forming caffeoyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate or  
/hydroxylates 4-coumaroyl-3',4'-dihydroxyphenyllactate generating rosmarinic acid. The consecutive action of a corresponding 
/3'-hydroxylase finally results either in the formation of RA (from 4-coumaroyl-3',4'-dihydroxyphenyllactate) or 
/caffeoyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate (from 4-coumaroyl-4'hydroxyphenyllactate), respectively. However, the order of introduction 
/of the 3- and 3'-hydroxyl groups could not be determined |CITS: [Petersen97]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS) was isolated from <i>Artemisia annua</i> and 
/its molecular function to cyclisize farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) forming amorpha-4,11-diene confirmed by 
/heterologous expression in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [11185551]|. The enzyme requires a divalent metalion 
/and prefers Mg2+. The function of ADS has also been confirmed in transformed tobacco |CITS: [11289612]|. 
/
/The reaction sequence has been shown to involve the following steps |CITS: [15797234]|:
/
/1) ionization of FDP to form nerolidyl diphosphate (NPP)
/
/2) ionization of NPP followed by 1,6-ring closure to generate the bisabolyl cation
/
/3) 1,3-hydride shift of the bisabolyl cation to yield a cationic intermediate
/
/4) 1,10-closure to generate the amorphane skeleton
/
/5) deprotonation at either C12 or C13 of the amorphyl cation to produce amorpha-4,11-diene

COMMENT - Eugenol O-methyltransferase (EOMT)  cDNA has been isolated from <i>Ocimum basilicum</i> using a biochemical 
/genomics approach. The enzyme was expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and the kinetic properties of the recombinant 
/protein characterized. The Eugenol O-methyltransferase (EOMT1) expressed a high similarity with respect to 
/apparent catalytic activities to the chavicol O-methyltransferase (CVOMT1), another COMT like methyltranferase. 
/However, EOMT1 has a broader substrate preference than CVOMT1, catalyzing the methylation of chavicol 
/with comparable efficiency but has a much higher affinity towards eugenol. The EOMT from sweet basil (<i>Ocimum basilicum</i>) 
/has a more specific substrate preference than the S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(iso)eugenol O-methyltransferase 
/(IEMT) of <i>Clarkia breweri</i> and appears to be only distantly related to IEMT. The EOMT1 has a pH optimum 
/between 7 and 8 and represents a homodimer (87 kDa) with subunits of 40 kDa |CITS: [11884690]|.

COMMENT - cDNAs encoding (11,14)-linoleoyl desaturases have been isolated from
/Trichosanthes kirilowii and Punica granatum. Ectopic expression of each cDNA in
/Arabidopsis caused significant accumulation of punicic acid in the seeds,
/demonstrating the "conjugase" activity. Transformed yeast cells with exogenous
/linoleic acid also accumulated greater level of punicic acid than those without
/linoleic acid, again demonstrating the "conjugase" activity. In addition,
/transformed yeast cells accumulated 16:2&Delta;9cis,12cis and
/18:2&Delta;9cis,12cis fatty acids, demonstrating the &Delta;12-oleate
/desaturase activity in addition to the "conjugase" activity.
/
/Both enzymes also have weak activity with 16:2&Delta;9cis,12cis and

COMMENT - Two genetic loci controlling flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3',5'H) in <i>Petunia x hybrida</i>, i.e. Hf1 and Hf2 
/have been analyzed and the corresponding cDNA's isolated. Hf1 was found to control the F3',5'H activity in 
/both the limb and the tube of the flower. The molecular function of the cDNA was confirmed by recombinant 
/expression of the enzyme in yeast being able to 3',5'-hydroxylate naringenin and dihydroquercetin to form 
/pentahydroxyflavanone (via eriodictyol - |CITS: [10476065]|) and dihydromyricetin, respectively. In addition, the complementation of the F3',5'H

/the 3'- or 4'-O-position of the B-ring are not hydrolized at all |CITS: [240725]|. It has been shown, that the 
/7-O-isoflavone specific &beta;-glucosidase of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> was able to hydrolyze both the glucosyl and malonyl 
/glucosyl isoflavones directly with similar kinetics |CITS: [11730862]|.
/
/This may reflect the different biochemistry of the interconversion cycle in <i>Glycine max</i> compared to <i>Cicer arietinum</i>,

/However, the existence of such a curtailed isoflavone conjugate cycle remains to be demonstrated.

COMMENT - The function of the cDNA clone was characterized by in vitro expression in E. coli followed by enzyme assay. Although the sorgoleone biosynthesis intermediate, 5-pentadecatrienyl resorcinol, was accepted as a substrate, the enzyme activity towards it was only 15% of that with the enzyme's best substrate pentyl resorcinol.

COMMENT - Flavone synthase I is a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, which uses &alpha;-ketoglutarate
/ as a cosubstrate in a range of reactions, inculding desaturation, hydroxylation and epoxidation |CITS: [15012289]|.  
/Related dioxygenases are found in bacteria |CITS: [2207091]|, fungi |CITS: [3145474]|, 
/mammals |CITS: [2492106]| and plants |CITS:[15012289]|.
/ In chrysin synthesis, decarboxylation of the cosubstrate provides electrons for desaturation of (2S)-pinocembrin.  
/
/Another flavone synthase, flavone synthase II (FSII), isolated from plants differs from FSI in several respects.  
/Flavone synthase I is a soluble oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase found only in Apiaceae, while FSII
/appears to be a microsomal P450-dependent monooxygenase found in other plant taxa |CITS: [10652133],

COMMENT - The NADPH phosphorylase catalyzing the hydrolyzation of NADPH forming NADP has been partially purified 
/from leaves of <i>Zea mays</i>. The enzyme counts for all the conversion of NADPH to NADH which has been 
/originally attributed to a NADPH-dependent nitrate reductase. The pronounced substrate specificity for NADPH 
/in comparison to NADP clearly labels the enzyme as NADPH phosphorylase |CITS: [Wells74]|.

COMMENT - Using the cDNA isolated from <i>Ipomoea purpurea</i> as a probe the corresponding cDNA from 
/<i>Ipomoea nil</i> was obtained encoding the respective 3-O-glucoside 2-O''-glucosyltransferase (In3GGT). 
/The enzyme adds glucose to anthocyanidin 3-glucosides at the 2''-O-position of the glucose moiety forming 
/the corresponding sophorosides.  Its molecular function has been confirmed by recombinant expression of 
/the protein in <i>E. coli</i>. The enzyme accepts all three major anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides, including 
/delphinidin 3-O-glucoside as substrate even though the latter has not been found in any morning glory species. 
/In the contrary, the enzyme could not convert anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucosides although they have been 
/identified in dusky mutants of Ipomoea. It appears that the In3GGT gene is regulated by an MYB transcriptional 
/activator (C-1 protein). This factor has been found to be severely reduced in c-1 mutants coinciding with a 
/concomitant reduction of the expression of In3GGT |CITS: [15842621]|.

COMMENT - The last step to form the isoflavonoid skeleton is the elimination of water from the 2-hydroxyisoflavanones, catalyzed by 
/2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (HID).  Although a spontaneous dehydration has been demonstrated under acidic 
/conditions |CITS: [Hakamatsuka98]| the rate constant (Kcat) under physiological conditions was 170.000 times faster 
/for the enzymatic reaction |CITS: [15734910]|.
/
/Hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase cDNA clones obtained from licorice and soybean, showed distinctive substrate 
/preferences and could be classified into HIDM (HID methoxy type - <i>Glycyrrhiza echinata</i>) and HIDH (HID 
/hydroxy type - <i>Glycine max</i>). The licorice enzyme exhibits a very narrow substrate specificity with a strong 
/preference of 2,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone, forming formononetin |CITS: [15734910]|. This substrate preference 
/coincides with the isoflavone pattern found in licorice, representing methyl-substituted compounds.
/
/The licorice enzyme is also most probably involved in biochanin A biosynthesis as it preferably dehydrates 
/2,5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone into biochanin A. This enzymatic step implies the 4'-methoxylation of 
/2-hydroxyisoflavanone naringenin, hence proposing a new pathway variant of biochanin A biosynthesis |CITS: [15734910]|
/|CITS: [12610212]|. 
/
/Both HIDs possess motifs characteristic of carboxylesterases, however esterase activities have not been detected 
/for this proteins. It has been concluded that the HIDs represent an example of recruitment of enzymes of primary 
/metabolism during the molecular evolution of plant secondary metabolism as suggested by Pichersky and Gang (2000)
/|CITS: [11044721]|.

COMMENT - With respect to the deduced amino acid sequence isoliquiritigenin-2'-O-methyltransferase (CHMT) shows strong 
/similarities to other plant OMT's, but exhibits a high substrate specificity towards the 2-hydroxylation of isoliquiritigenin.
/
/CHMT is expressed primarily in epidermal and cortical cells of roots. CHMT has been shown to be distinct from another
/closely related O-methyltransferase LOMT (licodione-2'-O-methyltransferase) involved in retrochalcone biosynthesis.
/Whereas CHMT can use licodione as a substrate LOMT is unable to methylate the structurally almost identical 
/isoliquiritigenin |CITS: [9055445]| 
/
/The CHMT has been crystallized and investigated with respect to the detailed mode of action for methyl transfer in 
/plants |CITS: [11224575]|

COMMENT - The expression of the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> gene At3g11480 was induced by both biotic and abiotic
/treatment and thought to be involved in plant defense mechanism by emitting volatile benzenoid esters. 
/The cDNA clone of the gene was functionally expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and its functions as SAM:benzoic 
/acid-salicylic acid carboxymethyltransferase (AtBSMT1) demonstrated |CITS: [14617060]|. The enzyme 
/belongs to the SABATH family |CITS: [DAURIA03]| and its expression correlates perfectly with methylsalicylate 
/emission when stress is applied to the plant. The enzyme is a homodimer of about 91 kDa. The pH optimum
/lies between 7 and 8.
/
/AtBSMT1 is highly expressed in flowers but is also found at lower levels in leaves and stems. The catalytic 
/efficiency of AtBSMT1 with salicylic acid was about 50% higher than with benzoic acid |CITS: [14617060]|. 
/The strong expression of AtBSMT1 after wounding, alamethicin and methyl jasmonate treatment and 
/<i>Plutella xylostella</i> herbivory supports the possible role of this enzyme in direct plant defense.

COMMENT - Recombinant PKSA and PKSB catalyzed the condensation of varies fatty acyl-CoAs with malonyl-CoA in yielding triketide &alpha;-pyrones and tetraketide &alpha;-pyrones, in vitro. Triketide &alpha;-pyrones likely represents derailment reaction products, with poor active enzymes becoming unavailable to perform the third round of condensation to malnoyl-CoA that is required to build up the tetraketide &alpha;-pyrones.
/ 
/In a substrate competition assay, PKSA clearly showed in vitro preference for hydroxyl fatty acyl-CoAs, i.e. preference for 16-hydroxy palmitoyl-CoA over palmitoyl-CoA, and a strong preference for 12-hydroxy stearoyl-CoA over stearoyl-CoA. The catalytic efficiency of PKSA for 16-hydroxy palmitoyl-CoA is 40-fold higher than that of palmitoyl-CoA. 
/
/PKSA and PKSB are tightly co-expressed with ACOS5. Both genes are specifically expressed in tapetal cells during microspore development in Arabidopsis anthers. Mutants displayed pollen exine layer defects.

COMMENT - Previously, microsomes isolated from developing seeds of Euphorbia lagascae was shown to posses a cytochrome P450 activity in synthesizing vernolic acid from linoleic acid bound to phosphatidylcholine |CITS: [8489257]|. Free linoleic acid was also epoxidized by this P450 |CITS: [8267615]|.
/
/A cytochrome P450, CYP726A1 was isolated from Euphorbia lagascae and heterologously expressed in yeast |CITS: [11842164]|. Its epoxygenase activity was demonstrated in an in vitro enzyme assay with the substrate sn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-[1[<sup>14</sup>C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine. The epoxygenase activity was also demonstrated in an in vivo assay of the transgenic yeast cells when the growth medium was supplied with either linoleic acid or linolenic acid. 
/
/CYP726A1 is strongly expressed in developing seeds, which is consistent with the seed-specific occurrence of vernolic acid in Euphorbia lagascae |CITS: [11842164]|.

COMMENT - Three cytochrome P450 81E subfamily members (CYP81E7 - 9) have been obtained from the EST database of 
/<i>Medicago truncatula</i>, two of them clearly involved in the 2'- and 3'-hydroxylation of isoflavones. Amongst them, 
/the CYP81E7 enzyme encodes for isoflavone 2'-hydroxylase catalyzing the essential 2'-hydroxylation of the B-ring 
/prior to reduction and ring closure, which completes the pterocarpan backbone structure |CITS: [14617078]|.
/
/Recombinant proteins from yeast were able to convert formononetin to 2'-hydroxyformononetin and biochanin A to 
/2'-hydroxybiochanin A, confirming the enzyme to be isoflavone 2'-hydroxylase (I2'H). The isoflavone 2'-hydroxylase 
/from <i>Medicago</i> was also active with pseudobaptigenin converting it into 2'-hydroxypseudobaptigenein |CITS: [14617078]|.
/
/The I2'H has been successfully introduced into Arabidospsis thaliana, where the functional protein hydroxylated 
/formononetin at the 2'-position of the B-ring yielding 2'-hydroxyformononetin, both compounds not naturally occurring

COMMENT - In Vaccaria hispanica, the triterpene carboxylic acid glucosyltransferase UGT74M1 may be involved in
/the production of a number of different monodesmoside saponins |CITS:[17172290]|.  The UGT74M1
/enzyme falls into the L cluster of
/<A href="http://www.cazy.org/fam/GT1.html">glucosyltransferase family 1</A> |CITS:[11042215]|.
/Several different triterpene aglycones, including gypsogenin, gypsogenate,
/16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate, and quillaic acid can all be glucosylated in vitro by recombinant
/purified UGT74M1. NMR analysis confirmed that the C-28 carboxyl carbon of gypsogenin is the
/site of glucosylation. But, given the low levels of gypsogenin-derived monodesmoside saponins,
/it is unclear if this reaction is biologically-relevant. Quillaic acid also does not appear to be
/glucosylated in V. hispanica. However, the saponin profile of V. hispanica suggests that
/gypsogenate and 16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate are likely substrates for this enzyme in vivo,
/and that they are glucosylated on the C28 carbon |CITS: [17172290]|. 
/
/In vitro, UGT74M1 shows the highest activity with 16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate, and lower
/levels of activity with gypsogenate (56%), gypsogenin (12%), and quillaic acid (11%). Although
/the enzyme has a lower apparent Km for the latter two compounds, it also has much higher apparent
/Kcat values for the two biologically relevant substrates, 16-alpha-hydroxygypsogenate and
/gypsogenate . Notably, UGT74M1 shows similar Kcat values for these two compounds, but it
/has a lower apparent Km for gypsogenate, assumed to be the primary substrate
/in vivo |CITS: [17172290]|. UGT74M1 does not appear to use UDP-fucose or UDP-glucuronic acid
/as glycosyl donors in vitro, suggesting that it not does add these sugars during the first stages
/of bidesmoside saponin formation in V. hispanica. In addition, the enzyme seems to have a
/preference for a subset of oleanane saponin aglycones, but it also shows some weak in vitro
/activity towards a lupane triterpenoid, betulinic acid. Magnesium does not appear to be required for
/UGT74M1 activity in vitro |CITS: [17172290]|.
/
/UGT74M1 appears to be expressed in the leaves and roots of V. hispanica, but not in flowers, germinating seeds, or
/developing seeds |CITS:[17172290]|.

COMMENT - Purification procedure of the cucumber enzyme showed a major activity peak of 66 kDa and a minor peak of 
/12.6 kDa. The minor peak was speculated of being a peptide fragment during the purification which retained the 
/catalytic activity domain. The enzyme activity was not affected by EDTA and many metal ions, except that Ca2+ is 
/significantly inhibitory. The enzyme has a narrow optimum pH of 6.2. Very little activity can be detected above 
/pH 6.5.

COMMENT - The benzophenone-3'-hydroxylase (B3'H) activity was detected in microsomes isolated from cell-cultures of <i>Hypericum 
/androsaemum</i>. Based on the enzyme's properties it was classified as a Cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase. 
/The enzyme specifically hydroxylates 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone at the 3'-position forming 2,3',4,6-tetrahydroxybenzophenone, 
/the common intermediate for both xanthone pathways (|FRAME:PWY-5002|). The substrate specificity of the B3'H was 
/highest with 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone and dropped significantly when providing dihydroxylated or monhydroxylated

COMMENT - The UDPG:coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferase (CAGT) was isolated and partially purified from developing xylem of 
/<i>Pinus strobus</i>. The enzyme has been purified from actively lignifying tissues as the accumulation of coniferin, 
/i.e. the highest activity of the CAGT coincides with events of wood formation such as the appearance of differentiated 
/tracheids undergoing secondary-wall formation and lignification |CITS: [Savidge98]| |CITS: [11430981]|. The partially 
/purified enzyme expressed high affinities towards coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol, as well as for their aldehydes and 
/dihydroconiferyl alcohol. The CAGT from <i>Pinus strobus</i> only accepts <i>trans</i>-configured substrates forming 
/the corresponding E-glucosides in contrast to the Z-glucosides found in <i>Fagus grandifolia</i> |CITS: [11537477]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding amorpha-4,11-diene monooxygenase (CYP71AV1) was isolated from glandular trichomes 
/of <i>Artemisia annua</i> and recombinant expressed in yeast. Its molecular function has been confirmed to 
/catalyze the hydroxylation of amorpha-4,11-diene to form artemisinic alcohol. The enzyme is multifunctional 
/and was both able to oxidize artemisinic alcohol to form artemisinic aldehyde and artemisinic aldehyde to form 
/artemisinic acid. The expression of CYP71AV1 indicates that the enzyme is trichome-specific |CITS: [16458889]|.

COMMENT - Plant glucosyltransferases are recognized to possess a pronounced capability to glucosylate a broad range of various 
/compounds, ranging from phenols, aromatic acids, coumarins, cyanogenic glucosides, glucosinolates  to flavonoids, 
/anthocyanins and monolignols. 
/
/The glucosylation of selected isoflavones is the first committed reaction towards the interconversion cycle of isoflavone
/conjugates. The remarkable high specificity of the purified glucosyltransferase for isoflavones and pterocarpans 
/underlines the involvement of those conjugates in the flexible production of defense compounds in legumes |CITS: [6458246]|.
/Trifolirhizin (maackiain-3-O-glucoside) is found in relatively high concentrations in red clover but vanishes almost 
/completely after infection to release maackiain as a defense compound  |CITS: [McMurchy84]|.
/
/The monomeric UDPG: isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase isolated from <i>Cicer arietinum</i> expressed a specifically 
/high catalytic potential to glucosylate the 7-O-position of isoflavones bearing a hydroxyl or methoxyl group at the 
/para - position of the B-ring. 
/
/The 4'-O-methylated isoflavones (biochanin A, formononetin) are the preferred substrates followed by the 
/4'-O-hydroxylated isoflavones (daidzein, genistein) with compareable lower turnover rates |CITS: [6458246]|.
/
/The glucosylation of hydroxyl substitutes isoflavones, flavones, flavanones, flavanols, coumarins, cinnamic acids, 
/and benzoic acids could not be catalyzed at all. Biochanin A and formononetin are the main constitutive phenolic 
/compounds in chick pea roots indicating that the isoflavone-7-O-glucosyltransferase may have been adapted in 
/legumes in both a tissue and substrate specific manner.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding chalcone synthase (SbCHS2) in <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> was isolated, recombinant expressed in 
/<i>E. coli</i> and characterized. The enzyme converts p-coumaroyl-CoA and cinnamoyl-CoA to naringenin chalcone 
/and pinocembrin chalcone, respectively. The molecular function as chalcone synthase was established through analysis 
/of <i>Arabidopsis</i> flavonoid mutants (transparent testa - <i>tt4</i>) where SbCHS2 could complement the mutation. 
/Pinocembrin was the main product when SbCHS2 was incubated with cinnamoyl-CoA, but the enzyme also had a small 
/rest activity (2.5%) as a stilbene synthase generating pinosylvin. The enzyme was strongly induced upon infection with 
/pathogens such as <i>Cochliobolus sublineolum</i>, the agent of the rice decease sorghum anthracnose |CITS: [15821144]|.

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding a pinoslylvin forming stilbene synthase (STS2) was isolated from wound and elicitor induced seedlings 
/of <i>Pinus strobus</i> using the STS of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> for screening the <i>P. strobus</i> cDNA library. The 
/protein was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and characterized. STS2 preferentially used cinnamoyl-CoA forming 
/pinosylvin and is therefore a pinosylvin synthase. The enzyme was the main pinosylvin-producing synthase in <i>Pinus strobus</i> 
/since the other enzyme STS1 (|FRAME:CPLX-6965|) only reached 3 to 5% activity of STS2. It was shown that STS2 
/preferred a higher pH than STS1 and that one amino acid exchange in the protein sequence was responsible for the 
/different properties of STS1 and STS2 |CITS: [7698342]|.

However, there is some evidence that |FRAME: CPD-12835| is made naturally in some plants, such as <i>Bromelia plumieri</i>|CITS: [PARADA96]|.

COMMENT - Purified recombinant UGT73K1 catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to at least three
/different triterpene saponin aglycones in Medicago truncatula, namely hederagenin, soyasapogenol B
/and soyasapogenol E |CITS: [15743451]|. Though single products are formed in these reactions,
/the exact location of the glucosylation remains ambiguous. For instance, soyasapogenol B may
/be glucosylated on its C-3, C-22, and/or C-23 hydroxyl group by this enzyme. UGT73K1 does not
/appear to glycosylate two other prevalent triterpene sapogenins, medicagenate (medicagenic acid)
/and bayogenin in vitro, nor does not it catalyze reactions using UDP-galactose or UDP-glucuronic acid.
/It also fails to interact with a number of different phenolic acceptors, such as catechin, |FRAME:CPD-3141 genistein|,
/|FRAME:DAIDZEIN daidzein|, |FRAME: CPD-520 quercetin|, |FRAME:CPD-3402 (-)-medicarpin|, and|FRAME:BIOCHANIN-A biochanin-A| |CITS: [15743451]|.  
/
/UGT73K1 transcripts can be detected by RT-PCR in flowers, leaves, peticles, stems, and at somewhat
/higher levels in roots. Levels of transcripts also rise in dark-grown cell suspension cultures about 8
/hours after treatment with methyl jasmonate and remain high for up to 48 hours.
/This matches the pattern of induction for |FRAME: MONOMER-12196 &beta;-amyrin synthase|, an important upstream
/enzyme required for the formation of the sapogenin substrates of UGT73K1 |CITS: [15743451]|. 
/
/UGT73K1 appears to be a member of a new subfamily of UDP-glycosyltransferases |CITS: [15743451]|
/within the larger <A href="http://www.cazy.org/fam/GT1.html">Glycosyltransferase Family1</A>.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding anthocyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside 2-<i>O</i>''-glucosyltransferase (Ip3GGT) was 
/isolated from young flower buds of <i>Ipomoea purpurea</i>. The enzyme adds glucose to anthocyanidin 3-glucosides 
/at the 2''-<i>O</i>-position of the glucose moiety forming the corresponding sophorosides.  Its molecular 
/function has been confirmed by recombinant expression of the protein in <i>E. coli</i>. In addition, the 
/Ip3GGT gene was introduced into Petunia plants causing an increase of cyaniding 3-O-sophoroside up to 
/80% of the total anthocyanidin content in dependence on the expression level of the gene. The enzyme 
/accepts all three major anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides, including delphinidin 3-O-glucoside as substrate 
/even though the latter has not been found in any morning glory species. In the contrary, the enzyme could 
/not convert anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucosides although they have been identified in dusky mutants of Ipomoea 
/|CITS: [15842621]|.

COMMENT - The function of the cDNA clone was demonstrated by in vitro expression in yeast, followed by profiling of fatty acid compositions. SbDES3 is a novel desaturase in that it is the only known desaturase capable of introducing a fatty acid terminal double bound. SbDES3 also accepts linoleic acid (18:2delta9,12) and converts it to linolenic acid (18:3delta9,12,15).

COMMENT - The last step to form the isoflavonoid skeleton is the elimination of water from the 2-hydroxyisoflavanones, catalyzed 
/by 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (HID).  Although a spontaneous dehydration has been demonstrated under 
/acidic conditions |CITS: [Hakamatsuka98]| the rate constant (Kcat) under physiological conditions was 170.000 times faster 
/for the enzymatic reaction |CITS: [15734910]|.
/
/Hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase cDNA clones obtained from licorice and soybean, showed distinctive substrate 
/preferences and could be classified into HIDM (HID methoxy type - <i>Glycyrrhiza echinata</i>) and HIDH (HID hydroxy 
/type - <i>Glycine max</i>). The soybean enzyme possed a broader substrate spectrum converting both 4'-hydroxy and 
/4'-methoxy-2'-hydroxyisoflavanones to either daidzein (genistein) or formononetin |CITS: [15734910]|. This substrate 
/preference coincides with the isoflavonoid profile found in soybean, characterized by mostly hydroxylated intermediates 
/and final products (daidzein, glyceollin).
/
/Both HIDs possess motifs characteristic of carboxylesterases, however esterase activities have not been detected for 
/this proteins. It has been concluded that the HIDs represent an example of recruitment of enzymes of primary metabolism 
/during the molecular evolution of plant secondary metabolism as suggested by Pichersky and Gang (2000) |CITS: [11044721]|.

COMMENT - Malonyl CoA: anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-6'''-O-malonyltransferase (SsMaT1) the enzyme that catalyzed the 
/regiospecific 6"'malonylation of bisdemalonylsalvianin and |FRAME:CPD-7714| with high efficiency was purified 
/from open flowers of <i>Salvia splendens</i>. In addition, the molecular function of the enzyme was confirmed by 
/recombinant expression of the isolated cDNA in <i>E. coli</i>. The enzyme did not malonylate monodemalonylsalvianin 
/indicating the presence of a second malonyltransferase in salvia nor was any intermediate of the pathway 
/without aromatic acyl groups (e.g. pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside) accepted. This and the fact that p-coumaric 
/acid and caffeic acid strongly inhibited the malonylation of bisdemalonylsalvianin indicate that aromatic acylation 
/precedes the aliphatic acylation towards the formation of salvianin. It appears that SsMaT1 has a cytosolic 
/location which contradicts the generally reported accumulation of anthocyanins in the vacuole |CITS: [11598135]|. 
/The reaction mechanism of this enzyme has been investigated in detail revealing the involvement of a ternary 
/complex that contains both substrates and the enzyme. In addition the importance of two amino acids, His167 
/and Asp390 for catalytic activity could be confirmed by investigating mutant enzymes |CITS: [12578391]|.

COMMENT - The monomeric isoflavone-O-methyltransferase (IOMT) has a pronounced specificity for methylation the 7-hydroxyl 
/group of daidzein or genistein <i>in vitro</i>, however it does not catalyze the 4-O methylation of the isoflavonoid nucleus 
/which is  prerequisite for the formation of pterocarpan phytoalexins via formononetin. 
/
/The 7-O-methylation of the isoflavone's A-ring is carried out with different efficiency. Daidzein is the preferred substrate, 
/whereas genistein was converted to prunetin with 36% |CITS: [8951042]| and 50% |CITS: [Edwards91]| of the original 
/7-O-methyltransferase activity, respectively.
/
/It has been suggested that the isoflavone-O-methyltransferase colocalizes with the membrane-associated isoflavone 
/synthase to methylate the B-ring of the 2-hydroxyisoflavanone before being dehydrated to daidzein or genistein 
/|CITS: [11752378]|, although dehydration is usually regarded to be the precedent enzymatic step to methylation in this
/enzymatic sequence.  
/
/Recently, it has been demonstrated, that there are two distinct O-methyltransferases involved in the pathway, one 
/(daidzein-7-O-methyltransferase - D7OMT) catalyzing the 7-O-methylation of daidzein forming isoformononetin and
/the other one (2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4'-O-methyltransferase - HI4'OMT) catalyzing the B-ring 4-O-methylation 
/of 2-hydroxyisoflavanone to produce formononetin |CITS: [12610212]|.
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-methyltranferase belongs to the first plant O-methyltransferases to be characterized by their 
/X-ray crystal structures - i.e. enzyme (IOMT)/product (SAH, isoformonetin) complex - revealing the detailed catalytic 
/sequence for methyl transfer in plants |CITS: [11224575]|.

COMMENT - Arabidopsis has six acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX) genes. In vitro enzyme assays have determined substrate 
/specificities for ACX1 (long chain), ACX2 (very-long chain), ACX3 (medium chain) and ACX4 (short chain). 
/In vivo studies of enzyme activities using each ACX mutants confirmed in-vitro results|CITS: [15743450]|. 
/In vivo, ACX1 is primarily responsible for C16-C20 substrates, ACX3 for C12 and C14, and ACX4 for C4 
/and C6.
/
/Expressing ACX4 in E. coli followed by enzyme assay indicated that ACX4 is active with short chain 
/acyl-CoAs ranging from C4 to C8, with maximum activity with C6-CoA. The enzyme is also active 
/with isobutyryl-CoA but not with crotonoyl-CoA. In vivo study of ACX4 mutant indicated ACX4 is 
/active with C4 and C6 acyl-CoAs|CITS: [15743450]|. The protein level is most abundant in 5-day-old 
/cotyledons.
/
/The Km for C6-CoA is 8.3 uM.

COMMENT - A flavonol-<i>O</i>-glucosyltransferase (FaGT6) was cloned from <i>Fragaria x ananassa</i>, heterologously expressed as GST-fusion proteins in <i>E. coli</i> and purified to homogeneity.  The  resulting glucosyltransferase was characterized as multi-substrate glucosyltransferase being able to convert a broad substrate spectrum such as flavonoids and hydroxycoumarins (esculetin, daphnetin, scopoletin) to their corresponding 3-<i>O</i>-glucosides. FaGT6 was higher expressed in achenes than in receptacles but while the expression level in achenes remained unchanged it increased in receptacles during ripening |CITS:[18487633]|.

BASIS-FOR-ASSIGNMENT - :MANUAL

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was identified from a cDNA library of |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| induced <i>Catharanthus roseua</i> cultured cells. The cDNA was expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized with regard to molecular function and catalytic properties. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UGT3) was able to catalyze the 1,6-glucosylation of 
/|FRAME: APIGENIN-7-O-BETA-D-GLUCOSIDE apigenin 7-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| to yield  |FRAME:CPD-14824 apigenin-7-<i>O</i>-gentiobioside|. 
/
/UGT3 only exhibited activity with |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| and catalyzed the 1,6-addition of |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| to another |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| molecule, hence forming gentiosides of varying length. UGT3 transcripts were only detected in leaves of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>.  The <i>in vivo</i> function of UGT3 as apigenin glucosyltransferase remains to be shown as apigenin gentiosides have not yet been reported from <i>Catharanthus</i> indicating another or additional function of the glucosyltransferase in xenobitics detoxification |CITS:[19561332]|.

COMMENT - Together with the SAM: 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4'-O-methyltransferase (HI4'OMT) involved in formononetin 
/biosynthesis a O-methyltransferase activity was purified catalyzing the formation of isoformononetin. The enzyme was
/named daidzein-7-O-methyltransferase (D7OMT) reflecting both substrate and regiospecificity of this reaction 
/|CITS: [12610212]|. This enzyme possesses the ability to methylate the 7-O-position of the intermediate 
/2-hydroxyisoflavanones as frequently reported for other plants as well |CITS: [9484461]|.
/
/The D7OMT could be separated from the HI4'OMT activity during purification and subsequent biochemical examination 
/revealed the difference of the two enzymes with regard to their substrate specificity.
/
/It is not clear yet what the intrincic activity of D7OMT represents, however the high inducibility of the enzyme, characteristic
/for all the enzymes involved in isoflavonoid phytoalexin biosynthesis, suggests its participation in host defense responses.
/
/The phylogenic tree of plant O-methyltransferases, developed as a result of the experiments from Akashi and coworkers 
/|CITS: [12610212]| shows that D7OMT and HI4'OMT from <i>Glycorrhiza echinata</i> are grouped to different branches 
/indicating a more remote relationship than originally thought |CITS: [11754938]|.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding the anthocyanin 3-O-glucoside-6"-O-acyltransferase (3-AT) was isolated from leaves of 
/<i>Perilla frutescens</i> and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The recombinant enzyme catalyzed 
/the 3-aromatic acylation with caffeic and p-coumaric acid for both anthocyanidin 3- glucosides and 
/anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucosides |CITS: [10845463]|. The purified enzyme from <i>Perilla frutescens</i> leaves 
/prefers the monoglucosylated anthocyanins over the diglucosylated anthocyanins with only little effect regarding 
/the number of hydroxyl groups on the B-ring |CITS: [Fujiwara98]|. The enzyme was significantly inhibited 
/after applying diethylpyrocarbonate and N-ethylmaleimide to the incubation indicating that histidine and cysteine 
/residues are important for the activity |CITS: [10845463]|.

COMMENT - A delta9 acyl-ACP desaturase was detected from milkweed, and its cDNA cloned. In vitro assay of the milkweed acyl-ACP delta9 desaturase showed it accepts substrates 14:0-, 16:0- and 18:0-ACP. Although the highest activity was measured with 18:0-ACP, the relative activity with 16:0-ACP is about 7-fold higher than did a typical plant delta9-18:0-ACP desaturase such as the enzyme from castor.

COMMENT - The spinach 10-formyl-THF synthetase was isolated to apparent homogeneity from <i>Spinacia oleracea</i> leaves.
/Antibodies raised against the purified enzyme confirmed that the 10-formyl-THF synthetase in spinach is monofunctional, 
/which is different from the trifunctional enzyme found in other eukaryotes. Applying those antibodies against the co-eluting 
/enzymes (synthetase, dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase) resulted in the exclusive immuno-inactivation and 
/immuno-precipitation of the 10-formyl-THF synthetase, whereas the other two enzyme activities were not affected at 
/all. For maximum enzyme activity both mono and divalent cations were required and the optimal pH was determined 
/between 7.5 and 8.5  |CITS: [1917961]|. 
/
/The cDNA encoding the spinach leaf 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase was isolated using the 10-formyl-THF 
/synthetase specific antibodies and compared to other THF synthetases of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. The 
/monofunctional spinach synthetase was longer than the two other monofunctional prokaryotic proteins and it was 
/proposed that the additional amino acids might be involved in the effective binding of higher polyglutamylated THF 
/derivatives <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [1644815]|.

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the transesterification of coumaroyl/caffeoyl-CoA and 4-hydroxy-/3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid 
/to form 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactonic acid/rosmarinic acid, respectively was partially purified from cell cultures of 
/<i>Coleus blumei</i> |CITS: [Petersen88]|. The enzyme was named rosmarinic acid synthase (RAS) and is active towards 
/several substrates resulting in either the endproduct of the pathway rosmarinic acid or intermediates of this pathway. The 
/RAS only accepts the R(+)-stereoisomers of the corresponding substrates. The enzyme readily catalyzes the reverse 
/reaction forming caffeoyl-CoA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid from rosmarinic acid. 3,4-dimethoxyphenyllactate and 
/phenyllactate were no acceptable substrates for the RAS indicating that a free 4-hydroxyl group seems to be essential for 
/the RAS activity. The preferred substrates for the RAS catalyzed reaction were coumaroyl-CoA and 4-hydroxyphenyllactate 
/resulting in 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate. The name rosmarinic acid synthase is misleading in this case but was 
/kept since it refers to the first observed formation of rosmarinic acid with caffeoyl-CoA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactate

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding the enzyme catalyzing the cyclization of 2,3-epoxysqualene to form &beta;-amyrin 
/has been isolated from <i>Medicago truncatula</i> and recombinant expressed in yeast. The molecular 
/function was confirmed to be a &beta;-amyrin synthase since beta-amyrin was the only product of the 
/cyclization of squalene epoxide by the recombinant enzyme. The involvement of the enzyme in triterpenoid

COMMENT - The enzyme catalyzing the final step from isoflavanones to pterocarpans |CITS: [Bless88]| has been named 
/pterocarpan synthase (EC 1.1.1.246). The corresponding enzymatic acitity in alfalfa has been shown to involve in 
/fact two enzymes (a reductase and a dehydratase), which is probably also true for the enzymatic conversion in 
/chickpea |CITS: [8071365]| |CITS: [7805842]|.
/
/Elicitors strongly induced the pterocarpan specific enzymes resulting in a five-fold higher amount of phytoalexins 
/(medicarpin, maackiain) in a resistant cell culture of chickpea |CITS: [Daniel90]|. In contrast, those enzymes were 
/only slightly induced in susceptible cell cultivars of chickpea, pointing to the relevance of pterocarpans as inducible 
/phytoalexins in plant defence. 
/
/The pterocarpan synthase, an enzyme located within the pterocarpan pathway section, was induced slowly without a 
/pronounced optimum. The increased activity could still be measured 48 hours after the elicitation. The enzymes 
/located at the entrance of a pathway  section (e.g. isoflavone-2' and 3'- hydroxylases) are characterized by sharp, 
/transient maxima, descending in activity 12 hours after elicitation |CITS: [Daniel90]|. The results  point to a differential 
/regulation of the activities of the early and the specific enzymes.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase was identified from a cDNA library of |FRAME:CPD1F-2 methyl jasmonate| induced <i>Catharanthus roseua</i> cultured cells. The cDNA was expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, purified and characterized with regard to molecular function and catalytic properties. The flavonoid glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferase (UGT3) was able to catalyze the 1,6-glucosylation of 
/|FRAME:CPD-14843 myricetin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside| to yield |FRAME:CPD-14844 myricetin 3-<i>O</i>-gentiobioside|. 
/
/UGT3 only exhibited activity with |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| and catalyzed the 1,6-addition of |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| to another |FRAME:GLC &beta;-D-glucose| molecule, hence forming gentiosides of varying length. UGT3 transcripts were only detected in leaves of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>.  The <i>in vivo</i> function of UGT3 as myricetin glucosyltransferase remains to be shown as myricetin gentiosides have not yet been reported from <i>Catharanthus</i> indicating another or additional function of the glucosyltransferase in xenobitics detoxification |CITS:[19561332]|.

COMMENT - The purified cucumber enzyme catalyzes a reversible reaction. Different from 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase I (L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase), 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase II (D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase) is specific with trans-2-enoyl-CoA and D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. Their isomers, cis-2-enoyl-CoA and L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, respectively, are not accepted as substrates. The enzyme has a preference for long-chain acyl-CoAs. Its activity is 10-fold higher with trans-2-decenoyl-CoA than trans-2-butenoyl-CoA.  The Km for trans-2-decenoyl-CoA is 9.5 uM, and 110 um for trans-2-butenoyl-CoA. Substrate inhibition was observed with trans-2-decenoyl-CoA above 70 uM.

COMMENT - Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) catalyzes the first committed reaction that yields the central precursor, 
/(s)-norcoclaurine, to all benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, such as morphine, berberine and sanguinarine, produced 
/in plants. Two major isoforms, with pI of 5.7 and 6.0, respectively, have been detected in T. flavum, a meadow rue. 
/The enzyme activity of the T. flavum NCS is highest in roots followed by stems, leaves and flower buds. The enzyme 
/activity is not affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>, nor is it inhibited by end products of the pathway. 
/The substrate binding of dopamine to NCS exhibits positive cooperativity. The substrate binding of 4-HPAA lacks 
/cooperativity. NCS is suggested to play a role in controlling the flux rate in benzylisoquinoline alkaloids biosynthesis.

COMMENT - The UDP-glucose:pABA glucosyltransferase (UDPG:pABAGT) was partially purified from leaves of <i>Pisum sativum</i>.
/Its proposed physiological role consists in distributing the folate precursor p-aminobenzoate (pABA) between the 
/origin of production (chloroplast) and consumtion (mitochondria) in a controlled manner. Although the free acid is 
/membrane-permeable its distribution/re-distribution occurs spontaneously among subcellular compartments in dependence 
/on pH and/or light-dark transitions. It has been suggested that the pABA glucose ester serves as an accessible storage 
/form for pABA. The UDPG:pABAGT activity is bidirectional and targeted towards the cytosol (together with an additional 
/pABA-Glc esterase activity) which is considered the probable spot for the enzyme to manage the pABA exchange 
/between chloroplast and mitochondria. The pABA conjugate has been demonstrated to be the predominant form of 
/pABA in pea and tomato (>80% - but does not arise in bacteria!) underlining the importance of the glucosyltransferase 
/for the plant folate biosynthesis |CITS: [12668665]|.

COMMENT - The phosphocholine phosphatase, catalyzing the hydrolyzation of phosphocholine to release choline has not yet been 
/characterized on a purified protein basis. The enzyme activity obtained from crude extracts was the highest in 
/non-stressed tissues of spinach |CITS: [12232019]|, but showed little variation upon salinization |CITS: [HANSON95]|.
/This finding is in contrast to most of the enzymes involved in choline biosynthesis. Hanson and Rhodes |CITS: [HANSON83]| 
/suggested the existence of a highly specific choline phosphate phosphatase in salinized spinach. This assumption 
/was concluded from a computer model processing experimental data with labeled compounds in the choline pathway 
/of this plant pointing to this reaction as a potential regulation step. However, it has also been suggested that the 
/release of choline from phospocholine may be the result of a reverse choline kinase activity |CITS: [KINNEY88]|. This 
/reaction was found highly reversible in castor bean tissues. It was therefore suggested that the availability of substrates 
/and the energy status of the tissue (ATP) may be determinative for the direction of this reaction.

COMMENT - The hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase (HPPR) catalyzing the reduction of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to 4-hydroxyphenyllactate 
/has been partially purified from <i>Coleus blumei</i> |CITS: [Petersen88]| |CITS: [Hausler91]| and characterized. Later on, 
/the <i>Coleus</i> enzyme has been fully purified, cloned and its molecular function closely investigated. It is assumed that the 
/reaction product is the R(+)-stereoisomer of 4- or 3,4- hydroxyphenyllactate since the rosmarinic acid only accepts the R(+)-isoforms. 
/HPPR is discussed as the first specific enzyme for rosmarinic acid biosynthesis since its substrate 4-hydroxypyruvate represents 
/a branch point for other pathways as well (|FRAME:PWY-1422|). The enzyme can use both NADH and NADPH but prefers 
/NADPH over NADH. The highest specificity of the purified and recombinant expressed <i>Coleus</i> enzyme was towards 
/3,4-dihydroxyphenylpyruvate followed by 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The methylation of the phenylpyruvate hydroxygoups results 
/in a lower (monomethylated) or loss (dimethylated) of enzyme activity indicating that the hydroxyl group in the 4-position is 
/essential for HPPR activity. The identification of typical protein domains indicated a close relationship to the family of D-isomer-specific 
/2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases which corresponds to the HPPR activity |CITS: [15284489]|.

COMMENT - The benzophenone cyclization to generate trihydroxyxanthones is catalyzed by benzophenone synthases isolated from 
/cell-cultures of <i>Centaurium erythraea</i> and <i>Hypericum androsaemum</i>. The 2,3',4,6-tetrahydroxybenzophenone 
/(THBP) is intramolecularly coupled to form either 1,3,5-trihydroxyxanthone (<i>Centaurium erythraea</i>) or 
/1,3,7-trihydroxyxanthones (<i>Hypericum androsaemum</i>). The enzyme(s) catalyzing the regioselective, oxidative 
/cyclizations, that occur ortho and para, respectively, to the 3'-hydroxy group of the benzophenone are Cytochrome P450 
/dependent. The enzyme activities reside in microsomes of the corresponding plants and have been partially characterized 
/as Cytochrome P450 dependent oxidases |CITS: [Peters98]|.

COMMENT - A cDNA encoding a pinosylvin synthase was isolated from wound and elicitor induced seedlings of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>. 
/The dimeric protein was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and characterized. The enzyme expressed high activities 
/towards cinnamoyl-CoA and dihydrocinnamoyl-CoA and was first thought to represent a dihydropinosylvin synthase 
/rather than a pinosylvin synthase |CITS: [1536925]|. However, it was later shown from the same group that there was 
/no special stilbene synthase for the formation of dihydropinosylvin but rather a high affinity for dihydrocinnamoyl-CoA 
/of the pinosylvin synthase |CITS: [1426272]|. The substrate preference was still superior for cinnamoyl-CoA which 
/determined the enzyme as pinosylvin synthase.

COMMENT - The full coding sequence of stilbene synthase isolated from a cDNA library of <i>Arachis hypogea</i> has been isolated 
/and recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [2450022]| |CITS: [LANZ90]| |CITS: [2033084]|.  Stilbene synthase 
/represents a multi-gene family in peanut of at least four members. It has been demonstrated that stilbene synthases and 
/chalcone synthase are two different enzymes demonstrated by antibodies raised against the purified stilbene synthase 
/|CITS: [6427224]| which do not cross-react with chalcone synthase. The substrate specificity of stilbene synthase can 
/be altered by few changes on the nucleotide level which also differentiate between stilbene and 
/chalcone synthases |CITS: [2033084]| |CITS: [8083886]|.

CITATIONS - BARZ89
COMMENT - The pterocarpan medicarpin is the major phytoalexin occurring in alfalfa. Isoflavone reductase (IFR) is constitutively 
/expressed in roots and nodules of unstressed plants, but is absent from healthy leaves |CITS: [Lopez-Meyer02]|. 
/Malonylglucosides of medicarpin are also found in these organs, indicating that these conjugates are metabolic 
/accumulated to set free the aglycons upon infection |CITS: [1912490]|.
/
/Isoflavone reductase is easily inducible upon fungal infection and/or elicitation. The elicitor-inducible promoter of 
/IFR was especially useful to investigate developmental expression in transgenic <i>Medicago sativa</i> and tobacco 
/|CITS: [7866024]|, which represents a species that is devoid of this isoflavonoid pathway.
/
/The IFR appears to be encoded by a single gene in alfalfa. It converts 2'-hydroxyformononetin stereospecifically to 
/the (3R)-isoflavanone, e.g. (-)-vestitone, in line with the final chirality of the (6aR,11aR)-or (-)-medicarpin |CITS: [7866024]|.
/The stereochemistry of the final pterocarpan is important for determining their fungal toxicity. The IFR provides  the chiral 
/centre at the C-3 atom of the isoflavanone |CITS: [Barz89]| and is therefore a preferred target for genetic engineering.
/
/The isoflavone reductase from alfalfa was found to be an cytosolic enzyme |CITS: [Lopez-Meyer02]|, which is not bound 
/or associated with the endoplasmatic reticulum.

COMMENT - The functional specificity of the isoflavone-7-O-glucoside &beta;-glucosidase of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> appears to 
/be very similar to that of the &beta;-glucosidase found in <i>Glycine max</i>. 
/
/The &beta;-glucosidase is found throughout the plant as multiple molecular forms and constitutes especially in roots 
/a considerable portion of the extractable protein. 
/
/SDS electrophoresis revealed, that the enzyme consists of two subunits (~68 kD) and the isoelectric points of the 
/various species ranged between 5.9 and 7.1 The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside specific &beta;-glucosidase showed two 
/pH optima, a broad one from 7.0 - 7.5 with an additional minor optimum at 4.5 to 5.0, in contrast to most plant 
/&beta;-glucosidases which possess their main pH optimum around 5.0.

COMMENT - The cDNA encoding a UDPG:glucosyltransferase in a <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> cell suspension culture 
/(CaUGT2) was isolated from a corresponding cDNA library using a PCR approach at the conserved UDP-binding domain 
/(PSPG-box) of plant glucosyltransferases. The CaUGT2 was recombinant expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and its 
/kinetic properties characterized. The CaUGT2 was able to catalyze the glucosylation of curcumin and its 
/monoglucoside in a sequential manner. The UDPG:glucosyltransferase had a broader substrate specificity 
/comparable to other plant glucosyltransferase but converted curcumin and curcumin monoglucoside with high 
/efficiency. However, the enzyme did not glucosylate gingerol and capsaicin, although structurally close to curcumin, 
/and did also not produce the diglucoside from esculetin. Although the enzyme was also able to use UDP-galactose 
/its preferred co-substrate was clearly UDP-glucose with a Km 4-fold lower than that of UDP-glactose. The 
/optimal pH of the enzyme was between 7.5 and 8. The expression of CaUGT2 was induced by methyl jasmonate 
/and salicylic acid indicating its possible involvement in defense mechanisms of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>

COMMENT - A monofunctional protein having delta-3, delta2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity has also been isolated from cucumber peroxisome. It catalyzes the reversible conversion of both cis- and trans-3-enoyl-CoA into trans-2-enoyl-CoA. The enzyme is active with 3-enoyl-CoA species having chain length of C6-C12. Both cis-3-hexenoyl-CoA and trans-3-dodecenoyl-CoA are equally active as substrates. Substrate inhibition was observed. The Km for cis-3-hexenoyl-CoA was estimated to be 170 uM, and substrate inhibition occurs at 100 uM with cis-3-hexenoyl-CoA.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase isolated from chick pea acts specifically with isoflavone 
/malonylglucosides and is different from unspecific (synthetic) acylhydrolases being active with naphtyl or phenyl esters. 
/Ultrafiltration indicated a unusual high molecular weight around 300 kD, however it has been shown that the enzyme 
/aggregates with membrane material. 
/
/SDS gel electrophoresis resulted in a single subunit of 32 kD.  It has been demonstrated, that the enzyme <i>in vivo</i> 
/binds to membrane structures which may be necessary to achieve full enzyme activity. 
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside-6''-malonate malonylesterase is different from other plant esterases being insensitive 
/to most of the usual esterase inhibitors. However, Hg2+ and p-hydroxmercuribenzoate did efficiently inhibit the reaction.

COMMENT - The isoflavone-3'-hydroxylase (I3'H) catalyzes an additional step within the isoflavonoid biosynthesis towards 
/maackiain. The 3'-hydroxylation is prerequisite for the formation of the methylenedioxy bridge to arrange the final 
/maackain B-ring skeleton. The enzyme has been characterized as a cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase
/|CITS: [Hinderer87]| |CITS: [Gunia91]|.
/
/The isoflavone-'-hydroxylase is involved in both maackiain biosynthesis and the formation of 2'-hudroxybiochanin A.
/I3'H preferably hydroxylates 4-methoxyisoflavones (formononetin, biochanin A), whereas the corresponding 4-hydroxyisoflavones 
/(daidzein, genistein) were not hydroxylated to any significant amount in chickpea  |CITS: [Hinderer87]| |CITS: [Clemens93]|.
/Among the 4-methoxyisoflavones I3'H shows no particular preference for the 5-hydroxy-substituted biochanin A over its 
/corresponding 5-deoxy derivative formononetin |CITS: [Clemens93]|.
/
/The enzyme is strongly induced by elicitors and precedes the accumulation of the chickpea pterocarpan phytoalexins, however 
/the induction pattern of I3'H differs substantially from that of the closely related I2'H |CITS: [Gunia91]|. The observation
/that I3'H, in contrast to I2'H, is strongly induced in susceptible cell cultivars of chickpea and the noticeable difference 
/in the sensitivity towards certain inhibitors |CITS: [Clemens93]| suggests that more than one isoflavone-hydroxylase account 
/for the four measurable isoflavone hydroxylase activities in chickpea.

COMMENT - A monofunctional protein having delta-3, delta2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity has also been isolated from cucumber peroxisome. It catalyzes the reversible conversion of both cis- and trans-3-enoyl-CoA into trans-2-enoyl-CoA. The enzyme is active with 3-enoyl-CoA species having chain length of C6-C12. Both cis-3-hexenoyl-CoA and trans-3-dodecenoyl-CoA are equally active as substrates. Substrate inhibition was observed. The Km for cis-3-hexenoyl-CoA was estimated to be 170 uM, and substrate inhibition occurs at 100 uM with cis-3-hexenoyl-CoA.

COMMENT - Three chalcone isomerase isoenzymes have been purified and tested for their substrate specificity from licorice. 
/Two of them (CHI-1, CHI-3), act on 6'-deoxychalcones involved in the legume-specific isoflavonoid biosynthesis, 
/whereas CHI-2  exclusively converts 6-hydroxychalcones, which is a distinctive activity known for nonleguminous 
/plants.
/
/Vmax (nkat x mg-1) for CHI-1 was 8.100 (naringenin chalcone) and 310 (isoliquiritigenin), respectively. 
/The apparent Km was between 3 and 8 uM, with an pH optima of 8.0 to 8.5.|CITS: [11673633]|

COMMENT - Isoflavanones formed from isoflavones represent the last isoflavonoid intermediates in the biosynthesis of pterocarpans 
/|CITS: [Dewick94]|. The soluble, monomeric enzyme catalyzing this step, 2'-hydroxydaidzein reductase (HDR), also 
/determines the stereochemistry of the final pterocarpans. The soybean enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of a chiral 
/isoflavone (2'-hydroxydihydrodaidzein) with 3R configuration in agreement with reports on  isoflavone-2'-reductases 
/isolated from other plants |CITS: [1915347]| |CITS: [1912490]| |CITS: [8037464]|.
/
/The purified enzyme isolated from soybean |CITS: [2306102]| expressed a very distinctive substrate specificity towards 
/2'-hydroxydaidzein and its O-methylester. 2'-hydroxygenistein was accepted as an substrate as well, however the 
/5-hydroxyl group in genistein lowered the affinity considerably. Isoflavones with a missing 2'-hydroxyl group were not 
/converted at all.
/
/The high substrate specificity and stereospecificity of the enzyme, as well as its fast inducibility by elicitors points to 
/the specific role of the DHR in the biosynthesis of glyceollin.

COMMENT - Arabidopsis has six acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX) genes. In vitro enzyme assays have determined substrate 
/specificities for ACX1 (long chain), ACX2 (very-long chain), ACX3 (medium chain) and ACX4 (short chain). 
/In vivo studies of enzyme activities using each ACX mutants confirmed in-vitro results|CITS: [15743450]|. 
/In vivo, ACX1 is primarily responsible for C16-C20 substrates, ACX3 for C12 and C14, and ACX4 for 
/C4 and C6.
/
/Expressing ACX2 in E. coli followed by enzyme assay indicated that ACX2 is active with long chain 
/acyl-CoAs and showed maximum activity with C18-CoA. The activity with mono-unsaturated acyl-CoAs 
/is twice as high as with saturated acyl-CoAs. 
/
/The Km for C18:1-CoA is 4.4 uM.

COMMENT - Plants generally have two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the heteromeric form and the homomeric form. 
/The heteromeric form is plastid-localized and involves in fatty acid biosynthesis. It has 4 subunits: biotin 
/carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), biotin carboxylase, &alpha; subunit of carboxyltransferase, and &beta; subunit of 
/carboxyltransferase. The &beta; subunit of carboxyltransferase is encoded by the chloroplast genome, whereas 
/the other three subunits are encoded by the nuclear genome. In Arabidopsis, BCCP is encoded by two genes, 
/BCCP1 (CAC1) and BCCP2|CITS: [11299381]|, whereas the other three subunits are each encoded by a 
/single gene|CITS: [10677432]|. The function of the BCCP2 gene seems to be redundant and not essential for 
/fatty acid biosynthesis|CITS: [Li05]|.

COMMENT - Recombinant PKSA and PKSB catalyzed the condensation of varies fatty acyl-CoAs with malonyl-CoA in yielding triketide &alpha;-pyrones and tetraketide &alpha;-pyrones, in vitro. Triketide &alpha;-pyrones likely represents derailment reaction products, with poor active enzymes becoming unavailable to perform the third round of condensation to malnoyl-CoA that is required to build up the tetraketide &alpha;-pyrones.
/ 
/In a substrate competition assay, PKSA clearly showed in vitro preference for hydroxyl fatty acyl-CoAs, i.e. preference for 16-hydroxy palmitoyl-CoA over palmitoyl-CoA, and a strong preference for 12-hydroxy stearoyl-CoA over stearoyl-CoA. The catalytic efficiency of PKSA for 16-hydroxy palmitoyl-CoA is 40-fold higher than that of palmitoyl-CoA. 
/
/PKSA and PKSB are tightly co-expressed with ACOS5. Both genes are specifically expressed in tapetal cells during microspore development in Arabidopsis anthers. Mutants displayed pollen exine layer defects.

CITATIONS - Weidemann91:EV-EXP-TAS:3317760769:hartmut
COMMENT - The malonylation of isoflavone glucosides has been suggested to be prerequisite for efficient passage of those 
/compounds through the tonoplast. Malonylation renders the isoflavone glucosides more water soluble, consequently 
/more suitable for vacuole storage. The malonylation step has been discussed as final step of the isoflavone conjugates 
/biosynthesis |CITS: [6639051]|.
/
/However, the isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase activity had been found strongly inhibited by 
/distinct isoflavone-specific malonylesterase and glucohydrolase activities in crude extracts of <i>Cicer arietinum</i>,
/which rather points to the existence of an isoflavone conjugate cycle with a subcellular compartmentation of the 
/enzyme |CITS: [6497385]|.
/
/The isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase shows a strong preference for isoflavones 
/being glucosylated at the 7-O-position of the A-ring. Best substrates are the 4'-methoxylated compounds 
/biochanin A-7-O-glucoside and formononetin-7-O-glucoside followed by the 7-O-glucosides of the 
/4'-hydroxylated isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Medicarpin and maackiain have not been used as substrates 
/in those experiments but their malonylglucosides are found as constitutive compounds in chickpea |CITS: [Weidemann91]|.
/
/Various 7-O-glucosylated flavones and flavonols could also be converted, however with a greatly decreased affinity for 
/the malonyltransferase. The 4'-O-glucosylated isoflavones could not act as acceptors, indicating that the 
/7-O-glucosylation is a precondition for isoflavone specific malonyltransferase activity |CITS: [6497385]|.
/
/The  isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase had a molecular weight of 112 kD. 
/However, other purified plant malonyltransferases acting on flavone/flavonol-7-O-glucosides or 
/flavonol-3-O-glucosides possess molecular weights of around 50 kD |CITS: [6639051]|. 
/Therefore, a possible dimeric composition of the chick pea enzyme has not yet been excluded.

COMMENT - A novel enzyme was recently isolated from Arabidopsis |CITS: [19833868]|. The Arabidopsis phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase, encoded by ROD1, catalyzed the transfer of phosphocholine head group from PC to DAG. Yeast microsomes expressing ROD1 had an enzyme activity of 0.6 nmol/mg/min in the absence of added PC, whereas the enzyme activity increased to 4.5 nmol/mg/min when 1 mM PC was added.
